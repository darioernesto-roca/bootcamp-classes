                    <li><span class="hour">00:00 to 53:00:</span> Greetings and questions about discord and the 1st exercise. Alumni and free domain for 6 months. Hosting and server. A hosting can have a server FTP (File Transfer Protocol), database server, web server, e-mail server. The mate thing. Wordpress and programing. Why to learn HTML5 and CSS instead of dreamweaver,  Microsoft Front Page, Wordpress and editors WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get), those are tools for people that don't know about web development. That's the no code development. But it is not the best quality code. Worpress, Adobe Dreamweaver, Joomla.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">54:00 to 1:04:00:</span> Summary about the last class: Colors. We won't usually use the name of colors. <strong>Hexademical color format</strong>: 0 to the f (16*16*16=16.777.216 million of colors) ffffff is white, 000000 is black and when I put on the same value, e.g: 4a4a4a it is grey. If a want a clear grey a go up, hence e1e1e1 is close to f, so it will be clearer. If a put on c4c4c4 it will be darker because c is a lower value. The format hwb has not yet compatibility with browser, so try not to use it. The hexadecimal format also has a alpha channel (transparency), two more digits at the final and they also go from 00 to ff</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:04:00 to 1:13:00:</span> <strong>RGB color format</strong>: Stands for Red, Green, Blue. Red is 255, 0, 0; green is 0, 255, 0; Blue is 0, 0, 255; Grey is 100, 100, 100. It also allows to use an alpha channel and it goes from 0.00 (100% transparent) to 1 (opacity 100%)</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:14:00 to 1:24:00:</span> <strong>HSL color format</strong>: Stands for Hue Saturation Luminosity (Matiz/tono, saturaci√≥n y luminosidad). Hue starts in red (value 0 starts), yellow is 60, green is 120 (middle), blue is 240 (finish), violet is 290; saturation determines how up or down is the color (from 0 to 100%) and luminosity determines how clear is the color, how much light it has (from 0 dark to 100% full of light). If you change saturation you can be becoming the color into a grayer one without changing the hue of the color. It is often used when you need to put some contrast, for example with buttons, when you need to change the color while it is in hoover state. As the other you can use the alpha channel (hsla), it goes from 0.0 (100% transparent) to 1 (opacity 100%). <strong>Try to always use hsl color format</strong>. </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:24:00 to 1:26:00:</span> Can I Use is a webpage to see if new tools are deprecated. You have to think the colors and using a palette of colors.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:27:00 to 1:39:00:</span> Typographies. Use emmet trick sheets.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:40:00 to 1:50:00:</span> Cursor handling: Ctrl + Left: move word by word; Ctrl + Shift left/right: Select an entire word; Shift + End: Select all line until final; Shift + Start: Select all line until the begining. Ctrl + Shift + End: Select all until the final of the document; Ctrl + Shift + Start: Select all until the begining of the document. So for selecting everything you can push Ctrl + Start and Ctrl + Shift + End. Ctrl + Delete erase the right word. Ctrl + backspace erase the left word.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:50:00 to 2:05:00:</span> Multiple cursor with the keyword Alt + Click simultaneuslly. Multiple cursors with the keyboard: Ctrl + Alt + Down creates multiple cursors to the line below. Double click selects a word, triple click selects a line, four clicks selects a paragraph and five click selects all document. Selection + Ctrl + D for selecting the next word with the same characters than the selected one, creating multiple cursors. A trick it's to select &lt;h2 and press Ctrl + D. Yo can analyse patterns to try to be "prolijo" and recursive.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:05:00 to 2:10:00:</span> In VS Code Ctrl + K + Ctrl + S goes to Keyboard Shortcuts. Then search for Toggle Case. Ctrl + Alt + U: Converts the text selected in Uppercases. Ctrl + Alt + L: Converts the text selected in Lowecases.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:10:00 to 2:14:00:</span> Ctrl + Mouse Roll to get the screen bigger or smaller and Ctrl + 0 to reset Zoom. Creating comments.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:14:00 to 2:22:00:</span> Link rel (stands for relationship) and the attribute "stylesheet". Then the attribute href (stands for http reference) in simple words we are talking that it is an address. In this href attribute we can locate an external resource or an internal one.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:22:00 to 2:23:00:</span> To create a css file there are different forms:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Creating a new file in the exploring bar with the extension .css</li>
                            <li><strong>Create the link in the HTML and Ctrl + Click in the address</strong>. It appears an error window and we press "Create File".</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:23:00 to 2:25:00:</span> Usually CSS files are not in the same folder than the HTML files. As same as images. Usually we put them in different folders for better order. By standard it is named css/style.css</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:25:00 to 2:28:00:</span> With link we can call the favicon too: link:favicon. For fast writing link: C + Tab. And with Alt + Shift + Right makes selection to grow with sense. Benefits from a external css file. It's more "prolijo" to work the two languages by separate; it is easier to work in teams]; it is easier just to link the style.css file to different HTML files and reuse the code.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:29:00 to 2:37:00:</span> Typographies are defined by the property font-family. The browser takes the first available. For that reason we put several Typographies. Usually at the final we put if it is serif or sans serif. Monospace: All characters have the same width (e.g: "Courier New", Courier, monospace;). Sans-serif: Without serif (e.g: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, Arial, Sans-serif) Those are font websafe, that means there is a hight odd the browser has it installed. In W3Schools we can find in the section Learn CSS/CSS Fonts/CSS Web Safe Fonts/ Best Web Safe Fonts for HTML and CSS. But there are procedures to let fonts available in the code for the visitor to watch it when opens the web page (e.g: Font-face and Google Fonts).</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:37:00:</span> Applying font-family to different elements.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:38:00 to 2:43:00:</span> Juan's recommendations about practicing, the exercise and validate with validator.w3.org. When there is a language problem because of Lorem text, to fix it write "zxx" in lang property.</li>

                    <li><span class="hour">00:00 to 06:00:</span> Questions about the font and exercises.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">07:00 to 11:00:</span> Generate template. To know what is the font-family used in DevTools (F12), select the element and look at computed and at the end of everything there is "Rendered fonts", there we can see the the font used by the browser. Examples about font-types in cumputed.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">12:00 to 1:05:00:</span> Long time ago we used div to create blocks but div has not a semantic meaning. Importance of selector specificity. The difference in the styles in a website helps to understand where begins a part and finish another. <strong>HTML5 incorporates semantic structural elements: Those are header, nav, main, footer, section and article</strong>. When the header is alone or is a body child it is understood that it is the main header and it must not be another one. Other elements can have headers. In google we can search html5 header nav layout to see examples about semantic structures elements location. The plegable property of menu is related with responsive design. It is possible to have more than a nav, but it is rare; it is recommended to put just one nav. Within main we put everything that gives sens to the page, the representative and differencial content from any webpage. Meanwhile footer closes the page, like header, when is body child or is alone it must be just one, but other semantic elements can have a footer, as articles and sections; typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright or links to related documents. The semantic structural elements are used not just for aaccesibility issues but because of search engine optimization (SEO).</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:07:00 to 1:40:00:</span> There also are sections and articles. Explanation about a section and examples. Movistar and tuenti example about the way they use to communicate with their customers. Comments about Encanto, the movie that says "casita". An article is an independent element, tells a story, they have title, develoment and an end, it can also have a header and a footer. The article element represents a complete, or self-contained, composition in a document, page, application, or site and that is in principle, independently distributable or resusable in syndication. An article could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, a user submitted comment, an interactive widget or a gadget, or any independent item of content. Hence, they can be share by social media or WhatsApp and is understandable. Instead a section element is the most general semantic element that we have.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:41:00 to 2:06:00:</span> An aside not necessarily goes aside the page, can bien down, or in other part, not aside the page. The element aside define content that complements the main information. <a href="http://html5doctor.com/downloads/h5d-sectioning-flowchart.pdf" target="_blank">HTML5 Element Flowchart</a>. Another semantic element is: figure. Examples about when using articles, sections and other elements. Recommendations. Review how real and known websites uses semantic elements. We can't put a number in the beginning of an id. Some questions and answers about lang property. Other accesibility comments related with the semantic elements and how browsers work.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:07:00 to 2:16:00:</span> How to select header and footer: with a class and with a child selector body &gt; header. Adding styles to sections and articles. Use colors for guiding while styling to see better what is happening with the code.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:17:00 to 2:40:00:</span> <strong>Using color palettes for styling a website. Coolor.com for trending color palettes.</strong>. In coolor.com we select de palette and click in "Open in the generator". There we can add more colors. When the palette is ready copy the URL and paste as a comment in the style sheet, then we take the hexadecimal number of each color and we organize it in a list with their names for better guiding. Padding should be the same in different elements, it is better to have high difference to a slight difference in properties like that. Right click and split down to dive the VS Code screen. Whe should build a website thinking that everybody can write it easily. <strong>Putting padding in main helps when margin top of h1 does not work.</strong>.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:40:00 to 2:41:00</span> Usually we put a width of 80% in main and center main with margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto. That way the page content will ocupy 80% of the space and will be center and will adapt to the device width.</li>

                    <li><span class="hour">00:00 to 06:00:</span> Questions about the ideal structure in HTML5. Asking about video example in Education IT.If we can put it in the header. Juan says we can but it is not recommended.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">07:00 to 16:00:</span> Accessing Google Fonts. <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank">https://fonts.google.com/</a>. For avoiding character brokes with the accents is better to use Latin Extended. Explanations about serif and sans serif. We can customize the text, ideally with accents. In screens we use sans serif. Examples of fonts. There are variables fonts (they support a bigger amount of thickness and variations, because they have defined the possibility to increase their trace) and font with styles (each style is a distinct file). Values of 400 are normal, 700 it is bold. It is recommend 400, 400 italic, 700 and 700 italic. Testing fonts to link into the HTML5: Source Sans Pro. Juan choose the regular 400, italic 400, bold 900 and extra light 200. We just select those that we need. There are two ways to link them to our document through several link tags: link or @import. Generally we link our style.css file where are the font definitions we want to be show by browsers. But with Google Fonts we copy the code created when we chose the fonts, we add it in the HTML5 head and after we add the link to the stylesheet file. The 1st two links helps to download faster and easier the fonts from Google Fonts and the 3th one in a link to a css file with the fonts we choose. Know, within the css file we have to put the code for calling the font, as same as it shows Google Fonts; for example font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">17:00 to 22:00:</span> The problem with using link is that sometimes we will need to change the font and it is necessary to update the new links in all html pages. <strong>For that reason we better use @import. That allows us to call an css file inside another css file.</strong>. We have to located in the first line of the css file, like this: @import url:('The address'). That way when we want to do a modifying in our fonts we update our @import url once in the css and that's it, we don't need to update any other links or pages.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">23:00 to 33:00:</span> Hard to read font should be used just for heading, not for the content. Some questions about fast charging. Link an import fonts does not affect the web page downloading speed. Today all browsers have functionality for this, that is called Font Face. With this procedure, when the user enters the page fonts don't get installed in the computer, they just download and are used while the page is visited.</li>

                        <span class="hour">34:00 to 39:00:</span> There are other platforms related with fonts like:

                        From this kind of pages we have to download the font files and unzip it in our page folder (it can have the name fonts). To incorporate the personalized fonts into our css we have to use the @font-face property. It will create the next rule:<br>
                        @font-face {<br>
                        font-family: 'My font1'<br>
                        src: url('fonts/fontName')}<br>
                        Then we can call it using the name, for this example, 'My font1' (it is recommended to put it within single quotes).
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">40:00 to 48:00:</span> When we established, for example, b or strong element in a paragraph the characters get bold, but it does not mean that those characters are in a font-weight: bold or 900 state. In fact, what it is really happening is that browser calculate or adapt the characters to be seen as that. But it can be similar or different to the original bold font. Hence it is important to define the different states for a font (normal, bold, italic an bold italic), so we repeat the rule @font-face as before, but linking the source (src: url) to the bold, italic and bold italic files, declaring font-weight: bold (for bold font), font-style: italic (for italic font) and font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; (for bold italic font), and keeping the same name: 'My font1'.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">48:00 to 1:00:00:</span> Box model. Example: div class="box box1". Then we add styles to .box and .box1, that is something more common that putting styles directly to div. Also it is common to name the classes with double slash: box--1, according to bem, that is a modification of the original class box. For more information go over <a href="http://getbem.com/" target="_blank">GetBem.com</a>. When creating secuence of numbers in VS Code we select all same type of numbers with Ctrl + D and then we press Ctrl + Alt + I to increase. In addition, we have the extension random everything to create random list of countries, names, last names, citys, numbers, dates and all other kind of stuffs. It works when we have several cursors, press Ctrl + Shift + P type ramdom and appears the different options. </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:00:00 to 1:03:00:</span> Examples of properties for boxes: width (300px; 700px; 500px;). Properties like height typically get adapt to the text content inside the box.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:00:00 to 1:26:00:</span> Padding: <strong>Important: when we add padding in a box we are increasing its size.</strong>, that can be a headache when we don't take it into account. To avoid this and keep the same box size, we need to subtract in the width the same amount of padding we're adding. Then we have padding-top; padding-bottom; padding-right and padding-left. To apply padding in all directions we just declare one value for padding. For example: padding: 75px. If in this last example we assign a width: 100% the box will be bigger than the page width and will appear an horizontal scroll bar. That happens because block elements have predefine the auto value not 100%. When we use percentage for width that is related to the container size. Questions before the break. In DevTools we can select a box or element, select the width or padding and press shift arrows up or down to increase or decrease the width, or with Ctrl pressed changes 10x, with Ctrl + Shift pressed changes 100x. We can click next to the semicolon and enters an new line to create another property. Box model presentation. We can also modify the values in the DevTools box model, but it changes it with in line code. However with refresh (F5) all disappears. But, there are ways to save those changes in DevTools/Resources/Overrides/Check Enable Local Overrides. There, it allows to add a local folder that replace or overwrites the css files from the server, for that specific page we are modifying. That way we can modify any site and then reload the page with our modifications.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:27:00 to 1:33:00:</span> Border: For applying borders we use the properties border-width, border-style (dotted, solid, double, dashed, none), and border-color (if undefined takes the color of the font, that means the color property).</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:33:00 to 1:37:00:</span> We can define in one line the different properties for border. For example: border: #acf solid 4px; (ir doesn't matter the order). As same as padding border-width increase the size of the element or box, then we have to subtract the amount of border added to the box width.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:38:00 to 1:45:00:</span> The same way we force the width, we can force the height of an element. For example: height: 200px; if we assign less height than needed for the content, this one is going to start to overflow. We can handle that with overflow: hidden; overflow: scroll; or overflow: auto.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:45:00 to 1:48:00:</span> For double dash and double dotted we can create another container (e.g: div) and apply a different border to it. Another possibility is to define border images. In Google search CSS border image to see examples. That way we can add frame, like pictures or paints frames. That's the major personalization of borders. <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/border-image/" target="_blank">https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/border-image/</a></li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:49:00 to 1:58:00:</span> Margins separates elements. They are distances between elements. That means that they are outside the element. <strong>The distance will be determined for the biggest margin value in each element or box.</strong> That means that margins overlap, the biggest determine the distance. There are some other circumstances where this doesn't happen. If we put margin-left: 40px; the box doesn't increase its size, that's because it has predetermined width: auto. If we put margin-right: 100px; the box will have a size of 100px less. Then we have margin-top; margin-bottom; margin-right and margin-left. To apply margin in all directions we just declare one value for margin. For example: margin: 75px. As same as we do for padding.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:58:00 to 2:05:00:</span> With those properties (width, height, margin, padding) it is important to assign a unit of measurement (px, %, cm, em), unless the value is zero. To put the block element in the right we use margin-left: auto. To put the block element in the left we use margin-right: auto. <strong>Hence, to center a block element we use margin-left and margin-right: auto.</strong> We can do that with headings, div, boxes, p and any other block element. Bear in mind that text-align is different to align the box using margin-right, margin-left: auto.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:05:00 to 2:34:00:</span> What happens when an element inside another element has margins. First, The margins can work with negative values, but padding can't. When the elements have padding or border (even 1 or 2 px) the margins don't go out the container or box. When in a box with margin-bottom have an element that also have margin-bottom the element's margin-bottom share the margin with the box. Margin-top: auto and margin-bottom: auto doesn't work equal as margin-left and margin-right. Box model examples in educaci√≥n IT website. Farewell.</li>

                    <li><span class="hour">00:00 to 09:00:</span> Greetings, Juan's birthday. Question about templates. He hates Wordpress and he's competence Joomla, there are site like Wix. Templates are generic and there are thousands of templates platforms. Question about frameworks and if we will work with them.The answer is kind of, we will see a little of Bootstrap, some examples with JQuery, but the important thing is to know how does it work. So we will work JavaScript vanilla, that means JavaScript without frameworks, JQuery, templates, from scratch, that way will be easier to use those tools after. Question about Flexbox and the topic schedule.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">10:00 to 15:00:</span> Summary box model part 1: it's more commun to use width than height in box model if we use height we have to take into account that element can overflow. The use of border, made up of values: border-width, border-style, border-color (10px solid black), it doesn't matter the order, if we don't declare a color it uses the font color. Also, we talked about padding, internal spaces of the element. We must use padding when an element has border and/or background-color. And we talked about margins that defines separation of elements respect to other elements. In the regular flow of elements margin-top and margin-buttom do not add each other but they collide, that means they share the margin and the biggest one determines the sepations of the elements. <strong>We also watched that in those cases when a text is in the top of the element and has margin-top, or in the buttom of the element and has margin-buttom, thoes margins go out of the container an collide with the margin above or below. To avoid that the container element should have a border or Padding.</strong> With margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; we can center the element. That's different to align the text within, for that we use text-align: center.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">16:00 to 20:00:</span> To explain the box model part 2 the class tutor uses a serial of boxes with emmet: .box.box--$*20{Box $} that creates 20 div elements like this: &lt;div class="box box--1"&gt;Box 1&lt;/div&gt; Then the class tutor creates a link tag for CSS &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css"&gt; and defines different colors to each one randomly. For that he follows the next steps:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Add background-color to the first element. It doesn't matter what color he picks: .box--1 {background-color: yellow}</li>
                        <li>With Alt + Shift + Down arrow he copies the declaration 19 times.</li>
                        <li>Selects number 1 of the first class .box--1.</li>
                        <li>Press Ctrl + D 19 times or until selects all numbers 1 creating the same number of new cursors. In the buttom bar of VS Code shows the number of selections and words selected.</li>
                        <li>Ctrl + End, put cursors in the end of lines.</li>
                        <li>Delete the text yellow.</li>
                        <li>Ctrl + Shift + P</li>
                        <li>Type color in the bar and press enter.</li>
                    </ol>
                    Finally adding some text to the boxes with 3 paragraph with 30 words lorem: p*3&gt;Lorem30.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">20:00 to 38:00:</span> <strong>Adding padding: abbreviation for padding: <em>p20 in CSS is the same as padding: 20px.</em> Padding in one line: padding: 20px; (for all sides), padding: 20px 60px (1st one top and bottom, 2nd one right and left sides), 20px 60px 70px (1st one top, 2nd one both sides, 3th one bottom); 20px 60px 70px 3px (1st one top, 2nd one right, 3th one bottom, 4th one left); clockwise.</strong> So 1st one always goes on top. This rule is the same for margin. <em>pb in CSS is the same as padding-bottom: 20px.</em> With padding we can add a generic value for of sides and then specify the size of just one side. Like first declaring a padding: 20px; and then padding-bottom: 5px;</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">38:00 to 50:00:</span> Now we can change the color of each border using the same rule: border-color: deeppink #000 teal; we can do the same for border-width: 40px 0 20px 4px. We don't need to declare a unit when we use the value 0 in CSS. In Dev Tools it is possible to see contrast ratio of elements, clicking in the colors in style sheet to assess accesibility issues. We can use different border-color to add lighting effects.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">50:00 to 1:00:00:</span> Bootstrap and Sass to compress code. When working with CSS and HTML we have to find a balance between create to much code but also to create clear and easy to read code. There is a lot of thing to see in border, we can play and try a few of them.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:00:00 to 1:10:00:</span> Applying border to body and HTML. We can add border and padding and realize body and HTML do not fill all the window. But, when we use background-color to these elements, the color overflows and fill all the window. That's normal. If we want that space to have a different color we can apply a color to body and another to HTML. Adding some more style to body. In body tag it's frequent to put some width and margin top and bottom, like for example 0 or 120px and margin auto to the sides, like this: body {width: 80%; margin: 120px auto;} Also it's usual to let the body width 100% and apply this styles to divs with the class .container or to the main. <strong>It is important to take into account that body has margins by default, in we want to remove them: In body: margin-top: 0; margin-left: 0.</strong></li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:11:00 to 1:24:00:</span><strong>Paragraghs also have margins by default. For that situation it is frequent to declare at the begining of the stylesheet the universal selector asterisk (*): * {margin: 0; padding: 0; box_sizing: border-box;} that is called to reset. Border box adjust automatically the size of the elements when adding padding, margin or border.</strong> There are other ways to reset, but that's the most known of all.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:25:00 to 1:49:00:</span> max-width and min-width define the maximum and minimum size of an element. Adding a nav with a elements and a footer with a p element. Applying styles to footer, header, nav, using width, min-width, max-width, margin, padding, background-color (to see how elements behave). For more aestethic colors we can use coolors platform. To choose a palet of colors takes some time, we have to test. different options and color tone. Applying pseudoclasses with nav a:hover and changing and reverse the order of the colors for that element.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:50:00 to 2:07:00:</span> CSS adjacent sibling selectors. <em>The adjacent sibling combinator (+) separates two selectors and matches the second element only if it immediately follows the first element, and both are children of the same parent element.</em> For example to select all paragraphs that come immediately after any image we can type: img + p {font-weight: bold;}. Now for all elements p children of the same parent element h2 we type: h2 ~ p {}. Take into account it functions downwards not upwards.They are useful to determine a change in the style when somenthing happens, for example a new sections begins, so we want the font-family to be change or something. We can also mix this selectors with id and class selectors: #paragraph ~ h2. (We can get the prime sign ~ with Alt Gr + + or Alt + 126). Examples of border-left-style and border-top-style.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:08:00 to 2:25:00:</span>Border radius. <em>The border-radius CSS property rounds the corners of an element's outer border edge. You can set a single radius to make circular corners, or two radii to make elliptical corners.</em>. Some use of flex box: display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 20px; justify-content: center. Border radius works as padding and margin: border-radius: 20px; adds border to all corners. 5px are more recommended, we can also work with percentage, like border-radius: 5%. If border-radius: 50% I will get a circle, but because we have an square box with width: 120px; height: 120px. Also we can change any corner, one by one: border-top-left-radius: 0px; border-top-right-radius: 55px; border-bottom-right-radius: 10px; border-bottom-left-radius: 30px; these changes in borders can be applied to an image. To hide content in a box, when content overflows we use: overflow: hidden; to add border-radius in one line we use the same rule as padding but with corners instead of sides. So, border-top-left-radius is like top side and border-bottom-right-radius is bottom side. Also clockwise. Like this: border-radius: 20px 70px 10px 0; or border-radius: 20px 40px;</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:26:00 to 2:32:00:</span> We can also change the width and height of the border radius separating it by an slash (/), like this border-radius: 20px / 70px; it produces a curve in both sides of the element, like a Chavo's barrel effect. For even more rare forms we can add several values to width and heigth: border-radius: 50px 3px / 15px; Now if we want to play a little with this there are sites like <a href="https://9elements.github.io/fancy-border-radius/" target="_blank">9elements Fancy Border Radius Generator</a>.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:33:00 to 2:38:00:</span> Adding border radius to the h1 element. Finally adding some color and style to the elements. It's pending the topic of shadows. Again about bootstrap and questions about JavaScript.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:39:00:</span> Farewell.</li>

                    <li><span class="hour">00:00 to 06:10:</span> Introduction to Javascript. In the beginning Javascript was used to modify the HTML. Also allows to work with events, for example when the users click somenthing happens. Javascript allows updating a web page in a asincronic way, for examples in social media when a post is liked it is updated but it is not necessary to update all the page. For this, it is used a technique called AJAX. For several years Javascript has been used as a multipurpose language. Today it is not just used for working within a website, but for other purposes, for example as a server language. That means as a back-end language. </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">06:00 to 07:38:</span> Front-end is the world of web. They are the characteristics within the browser. So the browser recieve the HTML, CSS and Javascript code and shows what we define. Once the browser receive all the information we can turn off the Wi-Fi and it will work and stay there within the browser.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">07:39 to 08:11:</span> The back-end is when the user wants to make an information search or when someone login in Gmail all the mail information comes from the back-end. In the back-end we always had especifique programming language as php, java, .net, python, etc. Javascript was always a front-end language.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">08:12 to 09:00:</span>  Before, to be a fullstack developer we needed to know HTML, CSS; Javascript and one or more back-end languages. But today we can also use javascript in the server side. That is possible through Nodejs. Also javascript could be use for IoT (Internet of Things). We could programm devices. Today is the most used programming language in the world. First we are going to use javascript in the customer/user side, that means in the front-end. Later we're going to make connections with the server to obtain data and finally we will use javascript in the server side. Also we're going to see Mongo DB a database system that works with javascript.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">10:00 to 18:00:</span> Hello world! As we did with CSS, with javascript we can work with a link to an external file (prefered way of working), having a block for execute code or having the code within the elements. The element we create for adding javascript in a block is the tag "script". Inside we can write alert('Hello world!'). It have to be in lowecases, because javascript is a case sensitive language. The code 'alert' shows a little window when refresh. It is not customizable</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">18:00 to 19:00:</span> Examples of personalized windows we can make with CSS: <a href="https://jqueryui.com/dialog/" target="_blank">https://jqueryui.com/dialog/</a> and <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/modal/" target="_blank">https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/modal/</a></li>
                    <li><span class="hour">19:00 to 20:09:</span> In javascript we prefere to use single quotation marks (') </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">20:10 to 23:39:</span> Variables and operators. In javascript block comments are created as in HTML /* */, but also there are line comments with //, those just comment a specific line, the next one will not be commented. Comment are usually located in a line before the code we want to explain not after. Or after, but in the same line of code. The script could be inside the head or the body.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">23:39 to 36:00:</span> Variables is a memory space that we name and put there a value. To create a variable we use the word 'var'. Other forms to build a variable that we will see later are 'let' and 'const'. So, example: var name = 'Ernesto'. A value within sigle quotes is called string, and behave just as a text. Also we can assign values as numbers (70 or 40 + 30). Variable examples. The word var should be just once after we declare the variable. We can declare again a variable using the word var, but according to Juan it should generate an error, but it doesn't. But for that reason we can modify a variable from before and no realize it. So we're going to try not to use it a lot, but in puntual issues.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">36:00 to 46:00:</span> The assignment operator is the sign =. It is not an iqual. Strings is always within quotes. Decimals are created with dots not with comas. +, -, *, /, ** (power) and % (returns the residual value) are arithmetic operators.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">47:00 to 1:10:00:</span> If we want to use alert is better not to work with live server. We can use open in browser (Alt + B). We can link together texts(concatenate) with +. For long name of variables we use _ or camelcase (example: nameOfThePerson). Again it is important to take into account javascript is case sensity. For that reason we always create variable name in lowecase. They can have number in the name but not at first. We cannot use - in variable names because it is an arithmetic operator. The dollar sign it is used just for jQuery objects. We can also use snake case (name_of_the_person). In the bootcamp we will work with javascript vainila, that means we will create project from scratch. This is highly appreciated by the market. name + ' ' + lastName to have Juan Romero.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:10:00 to 1:27:00:</span> Javascript is a programming language softly typed, it does means that don't need to define the type of variable but javascript recognize it and the variables can change without a problem. In other languages that is not possible. If the sign + has in both sides numbers it adds; if the sign + has in any side a string it always links or concatenates. Examples with sign + with texts and with numbers. Prompt is a pop up that allows users to add information (prompt('add somenthing'), but it is not usually used. <strong>Hardcoding values means that it is in the code for the eternity.</strong>.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:28:00 to 1:36:00:</span> We will prefer to work with the Console instead of alert. That console is a javascript interpreter within the browser. We can type with F12 to access to the developer tools in the browser and go to tab console. Some tests with console. Console show the line in which there are SyntaxError.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:36:00 to 1:47:00:</span> We can send content toward the console using console.log('This message is showed in the console with standard format'). F5 refresh the page. Ctrl + U for seeing source code. Examples with console.log. We can put variables inside console.log (console.log('day: ', day)). Within console.log values can be separated by comas. Examples of values are numbers (40 , 30), text ('text', always within comas), null (it appears grey in the console), undefined (it also appears grey). When it is separated by comas respect the type of value. Also with + we can concatenate values or operate an addition depending on the values. Regularly between operators (+, -, *, /, =) we leave and space and with comas it's like when we write, with an space after the coma.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:48:00 to 1:49:00:</span> Examples putting something in the visualizer from javascript. First creating a p with id="myParagraph", before the next script: var_p = document.getElementById('myParagraph')<br>p.inmerHTML = 'The text you want to write (for example: code, code)'</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:50:00 to 1:54:00:</span> <strong>It is important to learn how to use and work with the console (F12/console), as the palm of our hand.</strong>. Console is used to do test, to find errors.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:55:00:</span> The multiple example:<br>
                    for (var i = 0; i &lt; 400; i++) {
                        if (i % 100 === 0) {
                            // console.log(i)
                            console.log('it's a multiple)
                        } else {
                            console.log('it's not a multiple')
                        }
                    }
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:56:00 to 2:07:00:</span> A shortcut to create console.log is with Wrap Console Log and typing: Alt + Shift + W (let go) + W (Up or Down arrow): Creates a console.log with a string. Ctrl + Shift + W (let go) + W (Up or Down arrow): Creates a console.log with a value no matters the type of value. Ctrl + Alt + W (let go) Ctrl + Alt + Down arrow: Creates a console.log with the variable declared. Example: type month and creates console.log('month', month)</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:07:00 to 2:14:00:</span> Some console.log examples. Strings allows to make line breaks with .\n (backslash with Alt + ' (single quotes), n stands for "new line").  </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:14:00 to 2:23:00:</span> When an alert shows Live Server is not updated. For that and other reasons is not easy to work with alerts when Live Server is active. Becoming alerts in console.log. Difference in console.log between the use of comas and +. We can also show the result of operations in the console. This one is going to show the result. For example: console.log(5 + 5, 200) results in 10, 200.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:23:00 to 2:32:00:</span> There are combine operators like += that is a short way a += 50 that replace the following (var a = a + 50). It can be use with other operators like *=, /=. It take the variable, operates its value and assign the result to the same variable.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:32:00 to 2:33:00:</span> <strong>It is frecuent to want that the variable value increase +1. For that purpose we can type: a = a + 1 or a += 1 or a ++. Also there is -- and it decrease the variable value by -1.</strong></li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:34:00 to 2:40:00:</span> Increment and decrement operators: var b = a++ (postincrement) is equivalent to put b = a and in the next line to declare a++, for that reason b doesn't change. That means b = a++ assign the old varible value, if we want to assign the new one we should put the ++ before the variable, like this: c = ++a (preincrement). This last expression is equivalent to put a++ and then deaclare de variable c = a. For that reason it works and the result increase +1. It works the same for decrement using dash (-).</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><span class="hour">00:00 to 04:00:</span> Greetings. We name the javascript file into a folder named js/main.js</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">05:00 to 09:00:</span> Inside the script in HTML we add the attribute src="js/main.js" that links the js file to the HTML. When it's linked any code within the script will be read by the console and it is consider by the HTML validator as an error in the format required. That means it can't have any character, just an space, or a break, but any other character.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">09:00 to 13:00: </span> Types of data examples: Numbers: 70, 35, 204.36, 65 + 5, number2 * 2, 0, NaN, infinity. To see in the console what is the type of data we write typeof 70, or typeof 0 in the console.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">13:26 to 28:00:</span> <strong>To clear the console: console.clear</strong>.He touches right and left to see again what he wrote in the console. USe of typeof to call type of data of the value. NaN stands for not a number.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">28:00 to 32:00:</span> Boolean values are true or false. There are different way to generate a true or a false. For example: 2 &lt; 3 (true), 2 &lt; 2 (false), 2 &lt;= 2 (true), 40 === 40 (true), 40 === 37 (false). So we have numbers, strings and boolean values.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">33:00 to 37:00:</span> Another example to create a boolean value: He writes in console: 'This is a text'.includes('wednesday'), then the console says false. But if includes('test'), then the console says true.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">38:00 to 40:00</span> Also there null and undefined values. In general both are used indistinctly but, usually we don't put undefined in a variable when we don't declare a value, but null. When a methods find nothing returns null.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">40:00 to 47:00:</span> In javascript almost everything are objects. Arrays are objects, types of data that contains different values. For example: var array1 = [10, 20, 33, 40]. Each value is located in an index position within the array, starting by 0. Therefore, 10 is in position 0, 20 in position 1, and so on.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">48:00 to 51:00:</span> Prompt example: var name = prompt('Hello, what is your name?'). When the user answers prompt brings text or strings as response</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">52:00 to 1:00:00:</span> Interactive windows: 1.) Alert: alert('Hello, world!'). It shows an alert window. 2.) Prompt: var name = promt('What is your name'). It shows a window with text where the user can add information in form of strings. If we click OK prompt returns a string without characthers and when we click Escape or Cancel returns null. <strong>The value "null" is an object type of data.</strong>. What there is within prompt is called arguments. Hence, in the example: var lastName = prompt('¬øAnd what is your last name?', 'Smith'), the question is the 1st argument and 'Smith' will be showed in the window. This second argument is optional and the user can modify it, and is like adding a predetermined value.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:01:00 to 1:05:00:</span> It is important to take into account that when concatenating null + null returns 0. With prompts null + '' returns 'null'. Those are automatic operations. If also happens in multiplications with numbers and string, for example: 20 * '3' returns 60, even if '3' is a string. After the prompt we can write an alert('Hello, ' + fullName + ', ¬øhow are you?') and will show the full name the user add before.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:07:00 to 1:08:00:</span> Interactive windows: 3.) Confirm: var continue = confirm('¬øDo you want to continue the purchase?'). It shows a window that returns a boolean value (true or false). If user clicks OK returns true if cancels or escapes returns false.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:09:00 to 1:14:00:</span> Infinity + 300 returns Infinity; Infinity + null returns Infinity; NaN + 20 returns NaN ; NaN + 0 returns NaN; Infinity * 0 returns NaN (it's a contradiction).</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:15:00 to 1:27:00:</span> Conditionals: "if" condition on a sequence diagram. For example: if (rains) {I use an umbrella}. Another one: if (is raining) {I take a taxi}. Some examples with if. The if always validate if the condition is true or false. If true execute the code, if false don't.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:28:00 to 2:04:00:</span> Truthy and falsy values: We have the possibility to transform a value into boolean. Exclamation sign denies the following expression. For example !true is false, !false is true. For example var llueve = true | console.log(llueve) returns true | console.log(!llueve) returns false. All numbers (including Infinity), except 0, 0.0, -0, -0.0 and NaN, are considered truthy. All strings, except '' (empty strings) are considered truthy. Hence for transform any value in a boolean equvalent we can use !!true (not not true). For example: !!30 returns true; !!'Hola' returns true; !!0 returns false. It is used a lot to see if what we have is true or false. For example if we code console.log(-15) returns the value -15, but if we code console.log(!!-15) tranforms the value in boolean and returns true. We can find information about truthy and falsy in MDN web docs. True and false are values, truthy and falsy are qualifying adjectives.

                    <li><span class="hour">2:05:00 to 2:10:00</span> Known about truthy and falsy is very important for conditionals. Another example with numbers is !2 * 3 returns 0, because it is like multiply false * 3, false is automatically transform into a zero. In the same way true is transform in 1. Therefore true + 8 returns 9. Also we can deny the result of an operation. For example: !(2 + 2) returns false; !!(18+2) returns true; !!(18 - 18) returns false, because the operation's result is 0.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:11:00 to 2:16:00:</span> If else: if (condition) {code to execute if the condition is true} else {code to execute if the condition is false or not true}. Examples with else.</li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="hour">2:17:00 to 2:27:00:</span> Comparative operators: compare the values in both sides and return <em>true or false</em> according with the operator.

                            <li>&lt; lower than.</li>

                            <li>&gt;= greater than or equal to.</li>
                            <li>== equal (it does not take into account the type of data).</li>
                            <li>=== estrictly equal (it does take into account the type of data).</li>
                            <li>!= not equal or distinct (it does not take into account the type of data).</li>
                            <li>!== estrictly not equal or estrictly distinct (it does take into account the type of data).</li>
                        </ul>
                        Some examples of ==, ===, !=, !==. '50' == 50 returns true; '50' == '60' returns false; 50 === '50' returns false; 'hello' == 'Hello' returns false; 'heLLo'.toUpperCase() === 'HELLO' returns true.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:28:00 to 2:33:.00:</span> Careful with the operator =, because is an assignation operator. For example if (day = 'thursday'), we are assigning the value 'thursday' to the variable day. For that reason is important always to use === (estrictly equal) for avoiding problems. Only in very specific cases we use == (equal).</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:34:00 to 2:36:00:</span> Final examples:<br>
                    var totalBalance<br>
                    if (totalBalance) {console.log('Your total balance is ' + totalBalance)} else {console.log('You currently have no balance')}

The console won't detect HTML errors, just routes. Python use a console but is not the same as javascript, the concept of console is a generic term. Python uses a console outside the browser called terminal. VS Code has an incorporated console. A lot of programming languages have similar steps as compile. </li>

                    <li><span class="hour">00:00 to 03:00:</span> Greetings and some questions.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">3:00 to 7:00:</span> Use of if without curly brackets {}. It is not a good idea because the second console.log will always be shown, independently if the condition is true or not. That happens because without brackets the console takes it as console.log outside the if. So it is used just when the console.log will be just in the next line after the if. But it is not recommended.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">08:00 to 16:00:</span> Template generator extension.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">16:00 to 27:00:</span> Switch: The switch statement evaluates an expression, matching the expression's value to a case clause, and executes statements associated with that case, as well as statements in cases that follow the matching case. For more information about the switch statement <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch">MDN Switch</a>. It allows us to ask for a variable end to react possible values in the variable, as an if with a lot of else if for an specific variable. For example:<br>
                        var (day) = 'sunday'<br>
                        switch (day) {<br>
                            case 'sunday':<br>
                            console.log('It is Sunday!!')<br>
                            case 'monday':<br>
                            console.log('It is Monday!!')<br>
                            case 'tuesday':<br>
                            console.log('It is Tuesday!!')<br>
                            case 'wednesday':<br>
                            console.log('It is Wednesday!!')<br>
                            case 'thursday':<br>
                            console.log('It is Thursday!!')<br>
                            case 'friday':<br>
                            console.log('It is Friday!!')<br>
                            case 'Saturday':<br>
                            console.log('It is Saturday!!')<br>
                        }<br>
                        If is Sunday system will execute code after the colon (:), that means the console.log with the sentence 'It is Sunday', but it will also show all other next cases, with their codes. In switch the expression case 'sunday' is the same as asking if 'sunday' is estrictly equal to the variable. That means that the comparison can be affected by the type of data 'string' or number. It is possible to put to cases together to execute the same action. For example:<br>
                        case 'saturday':<br>
                        case 'sunday':<br>
                            console.log('It is Weekend')<br>
                        To cut the code we can use <strong>break</strong>, with this expression we tell the system to stop executing the code. That way, if we put a break after 'wednesday' the system will finish the task abruptly and won't show Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Usually in cases like this (the week example) we will put a break after any console.log for avoiding the system to show all other days. But it is not the better way to do it. Finally in switch we can add a <strong>default</strong> expression at the end, it is like an else, and we can use it to program what's going to happen if any case is true. For example:<br>
                        default:<br>
                            console.error('Incorrect or invalid day')<br>
                        It won't be necessary to put a break after the default, but it will be necessary before the default, that means after the console.log for cases 'saturday' and 'sunday'. By convention we locate the default at the end, but in fact we can put it in any other part inside the switch and will work all the same. But in those cases it will be necessary the break. But that looks rare, and it is not used like that. Switch is less used that if, because we can't ask for greater or less than, just for estrictly equal, also we have the aspect that is continues executing the following lines. If and his derivatives are more customizable. Instead of switch are often used another design pattern that we'll talk about later in the Bootcamp.

                    <li><span class="hour">27:41 to 30:00:</span> Basic fuction. It is a series of procedure that we name to call it is different momments when programming.<br>
                    Folding the clothes example:<br>
                    Folding a sweater:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Stretch the sweater on the table.</li>
                        <li>Fold it back in thirds.</li>
                        <li>Roll up the sleeves.</li>
                        <li>Fold it in half</li>
                        <li>Keep it in the closet.</li>
                    </ol>
                    Folding a T-shirt:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Stretch the T-shirt on the table.</li>
                        <li>Fold it back in thirds.</li>
                        <li>Roll up the sleeves.</li>
                        <li>Fold it in half</li>
                        <li>Keep it in the closet.</li>
                    </ol>
                    Folding a dress
                    <ol>
                        <li>Stretch the dress on the table.</li>
                        <li>Fold it back in thirds.</li>
                        <li>Roll up the sleeves.</li>
                        <li>Fold it in half</li>
                        <li>Keep it in the closet.</li>
                    </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">30:00 to 33:00:</span> For the above example we can create a function called foldClothes, this way:<br>
                    function foldclothes (){<br>
                    Stretch the sweater on the table.<br>
                    Fold it back in thirds.<br>
                    Roll up the sleeves.<br>
                    Fold it in half<br>
                    Keep it in the closet.<br>
                    }<br>
                    So, when we call the function foldclothes('sweater') it will replace all the steps for folding clothes in this case the sweater.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">33:15 to 40:00:</span> Functions allow to reuse code. It is possible to create a function in a file and call it from other files, as we do with CSS. Also with fuctions we can make the code more legible. The use of functions is like we are telling a story about the code, so it will be easier to read.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">40:00 to 42:00:</span> Example functionHello (){console.log('Hello World')}. We must call the funtion for it to be shown in the console naming the function, in this case functionHello. So, we can declare the function and it won't be shown if we don't call it. And we can call it the times we want.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">42:00 to 44:00:</span> ¬øHow does JavaScript engine works? Well, first it reads the code, secondly it executes the code if everything is in order, without errors and according to the programming orders. That means the code does not be executed top to bottom and for this reason we can call the fuction in lines before the fuction declarations lines and still be executed by the JavaScript engine.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">45:00 to 1:03:00:</span> Within the parentheses we can put one or several arguments. Those arguments are typically values ('strings' and numbers) or variables. If an argument is not in use within the function body the VS Code extension turns off his color, as suggesting it is not necessary to put it in there. Again JavaScript is a programming language slightly typed. Examples with different arguments or values inside the parentheses and how they behaves in terms of concatenation.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:04:00 to 1:07:00:</span> To show the type of data we can use the expression typeof, like this:<br>
                        var x = 20;<br>
                        console.log(typeof x); //returns: number<br>
                        That way Juan shows the typeof of all arguments in his example. For example:<br>
                        console.log('name: ' name, '(' + typeof name + ')'') // returns name: Martin (string)<br>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:08:00 to 1:13:00:</span> So, with an "if" or a function we can use typeof to program that something happens if typeof number or string, or not a number or not a string like this:<br>
                    Estrictly a number (===):<br>
                    var x = -204.3<br>
                    if (typeof x === 'number') {<br>
                        console.log('x is a number')
                    }<br>
                    Not a 'string' or different to 'string' (!==)<br>
                    function hello (name) {<br>
                        if (typeof name !== 'string')<br>
                    }
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:13:00 to 1:15:00:</span> The character for newline in JavaScript is \n. In Juan's example:<br>
                        function hello (name, lastName){<br>
                        var printHello = true;<br>
                        if (typeof name !== 'string'){<br>
                        console.error('name is not a string');<br>
                        }<br>
                    }
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:15:00 to 1:22:00:</span> To change the value of the variable after the if's execution we can assign inside the if body a new value to the variable. For example:<br>
                    function hello (name, lastName){<br>
                        var printHello = true;<br><br>
                        if (typeof name !== 'string'){<br>
                            console.error('The name is not a string');<br>
                            console.log('name: ', name, '(' + typeof name + ')');<br>
                            printHello = false<br>
                        }<br><br>
                        if (typeof lastName !== 'string'){<br>
                            console.error('The last name is not a string');<br>
                            console.log('Last name: ', lastName, '(' + typeof lastName + ')');<br>
                            printHello = false<br><br>
                        if (printHello) {<br>
                            console.warn('Hello ' + name + '' + lastName + '!!!');
                        }<br><br>
                    }
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:23:00 to 1:41:00:</span> Some questions after the break. <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_69#_command-center">VS Code June 2022 (version 1.69) release</a>. Juan trying to make us think about an condition: To inform error when both name and lastName are incorrect.  In that case it can work the logic operator or (\\), this way:<br>
                    if (typeof name !== 'string' \\ typeof lastName !== 'string') {<br>
                        console.error('Incorrect data')<br>
                    }
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:41:00 to 1:58:00:</span> Functions with return. Problems with emmet and new update release. Exclamation does'nt work. Another emmet shortcut to write HTML5 estructure is html:5. Alert does'nt work with comas, just with concatenation (+). Example of a fuction printSum (num1, num2) {<br>
                    var total = num1 + num2;<br>
                    console.log('total: ', total)<br>
                    }<br>
                    This is a basic but not too interesting function.<br>
                    Instead, we can add a <strong>return</strong> statement to ending the function execution and to specify the value to be returned to the function caller. Like this:<br>
                    function getSum (num1, num2) {<br>
                        var total = num1 + num2;<br>
                        return total;<br>
                    }<br>
                    Then we call the function:<br>
                    var resultado1 = getSum(10, 5);<br>
                    console.log('resultado1: ', resultado1);
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:59:00 to 2:06:00:</span> We can also call the variable inside the console.log. For example: console.log(Sum(10, 200)). As well, we can have the return inside an if within the function. That means, not necessarily a return is the end of a function.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:06:00 to 2:16:00:</span> Example with fuction divide (num1, num2). As it is impossible to divide a number by 0, num2 cannot be 0. Hence we put an if inside the function declaring that if (num === 0) {return null}. Extension SonarLint. The use of semi colons is a good practice.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:17:00 to 2:20:00 to 2:24:00:</span> Calls between functions. For example:<br>

                            return multiply(num, 2);<br>
                        }
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:25:00 to 2:35:00:</span> A slight reference to recursion concept: Recursion is a process of calling itself. A function that calls itself is called a recursive function. It can creates an infinite loop. Other examples for funtions calls between functions:<br>
                    funtion triple (num) {<br>
                        return multiply(num, 2);<br>
                    }<br><br>
                    function square (num) {<br>
                        return multiply(num, num);<br>
                    }<br><br>
                    function cube (num) {<br>
                        return multiply(square, num);<br>
                    }
                    }<br><br>
                    function cube (num) {<br>
                        return multiply(multiply(num, num), num);<br>
                    }

About this last issue Juan explains that it is possible, according to the situation to use variables to save the first answer and then asks for the variable later in the code. But it is pukka (or real or legitimate) to ask again, the same question, if necessary and the code demands. Some other greetings and chit-chatting.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">21:19 to 36:00:</span> <em>Scope of funtions part 1.</em> Scope means ambit, reach or range. Variables that are declared inside a function are called local variables and in the function scope.<br>
                    function sum (num1, num2) {<br>
                        var total = num1 + num2;<br>
                        return total;<br>
                    }<br>
                    Then we have to call the function sum (2, 5) and then use console.log(total) to show the return, but in this case it won't work because var total is inside the function, that way is not possible to call it outside. Nevertheless, if I assign a var outside (global variable) I do can use it inside the function. So, we can fix that erasing the var expression inside the function, in this way the variable become global (total = num1 + num2;). It is not a good idea or the correct way. The ideal way is to use let instead of var. It is a messy way to do it. The var total should be created in top of the JavaScript file, there it is global, behaves according to it and the code is more prolix or tidy or organized.<br>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">37:00 to 39:00:</span> Jos√© Luis's question about why JavaScript engine doesn't recognize the variable is we put it before the fuction declaration, because the engine read first all the code and the starts the execution. So Juan complements the question with examples:<br>
                    If we put console.log(x) before<br>
                    var x = 10 // returns indefined<br>
                    If we put the var x = 10 first the console will show the value 10<br>
                    And if the variable doesn't exist console.log shows error.<br>
                    <strong>The answer is because functions are not executed alone.</strong> For that reason, the engine reads all the code and then when execute the variable it starts to work. 
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">38:00 to 40:00:</span> if (confirm) example related with the question above
                    if (confirm('Do you want to execute the sum function???')) {<br>
                        sum(2, 5)<br>
                    }<br>
                    If we click OK the following function sum will be executed:<br>
                    funtion sum (num1, num2) {
                        console.warn('Accesing to x from sum function:', x);<br>
                        var total<br>
                        hello = 'Hello world!'<br>
                        total = num1 + num2;<br>
                        return total<br>
                    }<br>
                    When function sum is executed the variable hello is created and if I say no the code inside the fuction won't be executed by the JavaScript engine.

                    <li><span class="hour">39:00 to 44:00:</span> Because of the confusion Juan shows the clean way to do things: <br>
                        First we create our variables:
                        <ol>
                            <li>var a = 100</li>
                            <li>var b = 100</li>
                            <li>var c = 100</li>
                            <li>var d = 100</li>
                            <li>var e = 100</li>
                            <li>var f = 100</li>
                        </ol>
                        Then we access to them:<br>
                        Somewhere we can have the function xyz() {<br>
                            d = 20;<br>
                        } <br>
                        This function change the b variable value.
                        <ul>
                            <li>console.log(a) // All of them shows 100</li>
                            <li>console.log(b) // All of them shows 100</li>
                            <li>console.log(c) // All of them shows 100</li>
                            <li>console.log(d) // All of them shows 100</li>
                            <li>console.log(e) // All of them shows 100</li>
                            <li>console.log(f) // All of them shows 100</li>
                        </ul>
                        Then we can call <br>
                        function xyz() <br>
                        It will change the value of d. Hence the console.log(d) after the function will be changed to 20. <strong>This is the way developers work, with variables defined</strong>. But it is not a rule that all global variables must be declared or assign at the begining, that is not necessary, we can create them as needed. That's something we're going to feel natural with progress.

                        Everytime we call the fuction the variable amountOfSums is assign with + 1, we can also use amounOfSums++ inside the function or amountOfSums += 1. In this case it will be ideal to declare the variable var amountOfSums = 0 globally in top of the file. <strong>Also we can assign a set of variables all in once, just separeted with comas, like this: var amountOfSums = 0, x = 1, y = 2, z = 3.

                    <li><span class="hour">53:00 to 58:00:</span> If inside the function we declare the variable amountOfSums with the expression var what will happen is that we will be creating another amountOfSums variable, but local and with the same name but with no relationship with the amountOfSums global variable. If the variable is not defined yet we can not call it inside the same variable. That means if we put: <br>
                        var x = x + 20 <br>
                        It will be showed in the console as NaN, because undefined + 20 is NaN.

                    <li><span class="hour">59:00 to 1:07:00:</span> The use of semicolons and a long argumentation from Juan about why he doesn't use semicolons. There are some escenarios where is can create an error in the code. For example, after parentheses liki in sum (10, 2) it should be a semicolon. But in general in programming things can be done by different ways, like without using brackets {} or semicolons (;) or quotes "", and so on.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:08:00 to 1:13:00:</span> While: The while statement creates a loop that executes a specified statement as long as the test condition evaluates to true. The condition is evaluated before executing the statement. In structure is like an if, you know: if (true) {console.log('Something happens')}. Hence if we replace the if the code inside the brackets will be executed forever, causing a loop. The difference with if is that before finishing we asks again for the same condition until it'll be false. So, this is an example of a typical infinite loop: <br>
                    while (true) { <br>
                        console.log('Something happens') <br>
                    } <br>

So we have to stop abruptly the process in task manager (Ctrl + Alt + Delete). If the condition is false the while won't ever be executed. To avoid the infinite loop we have to, first to determine a propriate comparative operator in the condition, and secondly to use an increment or decrement operator or an assignment operator inside the while to change the value of the variable or argument, until it get higher or lower the condition, and eventually stops the while, that means the condition becomes false. Like this: <br>
                    var counter = 0
                    while (counter &lt; 5) { <br>
                        console.log('Show something in the console'); <br>
                        counter++ <br>
                    } <br>
                    console.log will show a counting from 0 to 5. <strong>In real life this counter variable is named i. This is like an standard name. Can be related with increment, integer or index. In any case it will be always named i. So i is equals to counter.</strong> But, if the counter is inside a while anidated to another while, by convention should be named j, and if a while inside another while and another, then is called k. Also i can be like a complement for a name, like iProduct, iCourse, iStudent, iSomething.

                    <li><span class="hour">1:25:00 to 1:35:00:</span> After the while the variable i has the value 5, son in the next while, when we call i, this one has the value 5, and for that reason this while does nothing. So we need to reset the variable assigning a new value, but without coding again the expression var; just i = 0. Other cases using while and increments: <br>
                        i = 0 <br>
                        while (i &lt; 5) { <br>

                            i++ <br>
                        } <br>
                        In this last example the console result are numbers between 0 and 5. <br>
                        Another example putting i++ above the console.log shows that the range will be between 1 and 5, because the i++ adds 1 before showing the console.log to be executed.

                    To solve this in the example above we need to change the comparative operator by &gt; and the postincrement operator i++ by a postdecrement operator i--. 
                    i = 0 <br>
                        while (i &gt; 4) { <br>
                            console.log('Message #' + i) <br>
                            i-- <br>
                        } <br>
                    Explanation about why if we put i++ above the console.log shows that the range will be between 1 and 5, in the example above.

                    <li><span class="hour">2:10:00 to 2:18:00:</span> Case 8 using while and confirm. We have to take into account that a while is like an if, but instead of finishing the process after the code execution it asks again for the condition:
                    console.warn ('case 8') <br>
                    var menssage = 'Do you want to keep seeing this message?' <br>

                        keepShowing = confirm(message) <br>
                    } <br>
                    console.log('End of the while')

                    <li><span class="hour">2:18:00 to 2:19:00:</span> The next exercise is to adapt the code above to write the confirm() just once. But is has to keep the same fuctionality, that means accept, accept, accept, and cancel (when we want to close).</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:19:00 to 2:21:00:</span> The while is used a lot in programming. For example automatize code in a e-commerce web site to add new products in a catalogue, because there is a lot of HTML and CSS code repeated, so we can with while to program this. While is just one of the repetitive structures, but there are other as the do while. There are cases where the while can be exacuted always (infinite loop), and others where it is never executed or maybe just but once (in this last case is accompained by do, that's the famous do...while statement).</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:22:00 to 2:25:00:</span> Do...while. The do...while statement creates a loop that executes a specified statement until the test condition evaluates to false. The condition is evaluated after executing the statement, resulting in the specified statement executing at least once. For example: <br>
                    var i = 33 <br>
                    do { <br>
                        console.log(Hello world!!) <br>
                        i++ <br>
                    } while (i &lt; 18) <br>
                    It shows in the console Hello world!! just once, because the code inside the do is executed first and then asks about the condition. As in this case the condition is false the code is executed just once. So the do...while always executes the code at least once. <em>It is easier to ask for forgiveness than to ask for permission</em>.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:25:00 to 2:28:00:</span> Another case for do...while is: <br>
                    i = 0 <br>
                    do { <br>
                        console.log(i) <br>
                        i++ <br>
                    } while( i &lt; 5) <br>
                    console.log('Fin del while') <br>
                    The do...while is used just in specific situations. It is more frecuent to use while alone.

                <h3>Timeline and notes Class 18.</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="hour">00:00 to 06:27:</span> Asking about personal feedback.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">06:27 to 17:00:</span> The use of for. The for statement creates a loop that consists of three optional expressions, enclosed in parentheses and separated by semicolons, followed by a statement (usually a block statement) to be executed in the loop. Explanation about the use of semicolon.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">17:00 to 18:00:</span> Now, the use of for. First an example of while:
                    var i = 0; <br>
                    while (i &lt; 10) {<br>
                        console.log('A message in the console')<br>
                        i++ <br>
                    }<br>
                    This message inside the while is executed 10 times in the console. For this regular use of while is design the for. The for statement contemplate th need to star something, the need to verify certain condition and the need to change the value. The part inside the brackets is customized depending on the need. So, the for solves this three needs in just one line.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">18:00 to 20:00:</span> The classic for statement is for ( 1st part; 2nd part; 3th part). In the 1st part we put the initializing code, that means the code we want to be executed first even before the start of the for, that code will repeated with each iteration (In our while example, it's equivalent to var i = 0). In the 2nd part we put the condition (i &lt; 10) and verify if is true or false. And in the 3th part we put a counter or a change in the value (i++) to allow the for to be closer to not being true. This way: <br>
                    for (var i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++){ <br>
                        console.log('A message in the console') <br>
                    } <br>
                    This way we can replace the "while" above for a shorter expression called "for".
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">20:00 to 22:00:</span> If we're going to create another for, like the same the variable i is already created, so we don't use the word var. <em>"After is the same"</em>. </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">22:00 to 23:00:</span> Another example, decreasing 4 to 0: <br>
                    for (i = 4; i &gt;= 0; i++) {
                        console.log('Value of i:', i); <br>
                    } <br>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">23:55 to 27:00:</span> Now, we can let the three parts empty. Like this: for ( ; ; ) {}. It won't create an error, instead it will create an infinite loop. That's because when executing the Javascript engine check into the for and see there is nothing to initialize in the 1st part. Then, when there is nothing in the 2nd part is always evaluated as a true. So we have an infinite loop, because the condition is always true, and as there is no counter or change in the variable, that means there is no i++, it will always be true. So, we can assign of star the variable outside the for, as a global variable. Also, the i++ can be inside the brackets. But it is rare because for doing that is better to use a while. So, it will be something like this:
                    i = 0 <br>
                    for ( ; i &lt; 5; ) { <br>
                        console.log('Value of i:' i); <br>
                        i++; <br>
                    } <br>
                    If we put anything in the 2nd part we're going to have an infinite loop.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">28:00 to 31:00:</span> Break: <em>The break statement terminates the current loop, switch, or label statement and transfers program control to the statement following the terminated statement. We can used with while, for, and switch.</em> It is a reserved word in JavaScript to cut abruptly a repetitive structure.
                    For example: <br>
                    var i = 0; <br>
                    while (i &lt; 20) { <br>
                        i++; <br>
                        console.log('Value of i:', i); <br>
                    } <br>
                    This will create a display from 0 to 20
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">32:00 to 35:00:</span> Now, if in the example above we want something happens from 6 to 11 we can add an if with the condition i &gt= 6 && i &lt= 11. For example: <br>
                    var i = 0; <br>
                    while (i &lt; 20) { <br>
                        i++; <br>
                        if (i &gt= 6 && i &lt= 11) { <br>
                            console.log('value of i between 6 and 11');
                        }
                        console.warn('Value of i:', i); <br>
                    } <br>
                    If we put the expression "continue" (without quotes) inside the if all the if statement will be like cut and it will continue with the other numbers. The continue cut the loop and restarts again. That way <em>the continue statement terminates execution of the statements in the current iteration of the current or labeled loop, and continues execution of the loop with the next iteration</em>. So, the continue could be apply like this:
                    var i = 0; <br>
                    while (i &lt; 20) { <br>
                        i++; <br>
                        if (i &gt= 6 && i &lt= 11) { <br>
                            console.log('value of i between 6 and 11');
                            console.log('.');
                            console.log('..');
                            console.log('...');
                            continue;
                        }
                        console.warn('Value of i:', i); <br>
                    } <br>
                    The continue avoid the execution of the if condition, and avoid the console to show the console.warn for the values between 6 and 11. If we put the continue after console.log('.'); it won't show  console.log('..'); neither console.log('...'); <br>
                    The statements break and continue are the best way to solve the exercise class 17 time 1:50 to 1:54:00.

                    <li><span class="hour">35:00 to 39:00:</span> Applications of break and continue. First until now we just know how a while can repeat the same word or number a secuence of number, but Juan explains that adding some more code we can program the while to add name 0 and last name 0, name 1 and last name 1, name 2 and last namne 2, and so on. Those are things related with arrays and lists. Juan's example about a list of clinic pacient names: <br>

                    <li><span class="hour">40:00 to 41:00:</span> If we put a break inside the while it just finishes the while. So, applying a break to the second last example we can use an if, like this:
                    var i = 0; <br>
                    while (i &lt; 20) { <br>

                            console.log('value of i between 6 and 11');
                            console.log('.');
                            console.log('..');
                            console.log('...');

                        if (i === 17) { <br>
                            break;
                        }
                    } <br>
                    So, console.log will show just until 17.

                    <li><span class="hour">44:00 to 59:00:</span> Now, we can also use a confirm, to ask the user if he wants to interrupt a cycle. Like this:
                    for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) { <br>
                        console.log ('Helloooooooo'); <br>
                        console.log (i); <br>
                        if (i === 6) { <br>
                            continue; <br>
                        } <br>
                        console.log ('**********************'); <br>
                        if (i === 8) { <br>
                            var interrupt = confirm('¬øDo you want to interrupt the cycle?') <br>
                            if (interrupt) { <br>
                                break; <br>
                            }<br>
                        } <br>
                    } <br>
                    In the nested "if" we don't need to ask if interrupt === true or false, because confirm automatically returns a true or false value depending on the user's answer. Now in a comparative statement with logic operators the JavaScript engine operates trying not to do additional effort. That mean, if we have if (i === 8 && confirm('Do you want to interrupt the cycle?') {break}, when i === 8 is false the JavaScript engine doesn't matter to continue analizing the next part of the &&, because in any case it will be a false result. That's why in this example JavaScript show the confirme pop-up just once. That is called a lazy expression. The break and continue should be inside an structure to have sense, like a while, for, if, or switch. Outside those they won't do anything because there will be nothing to cut and you can put as many as you want as long as it makes sense. In general the break is usually located inside an if, depending on something to be executed. Real example to use break: <br>
                    var names = []; <br>
                    var nextName = ''; <br>
                    while (true) { <br>
                        nextName = prompt('Put the name: (Let it empty to cancel)'); <br>
                        if (nextName === '') { <br>
                            break: <br>
                        } <br>

Another example using the logical operator not (!): <br>
                    var text = ''; <br>
                    if (!text) { <br>

                    Using this we can't replace in the example above the expression if (nextName === ''), by if (!nextName). It is more intuitive and includes cases when the user clicks Cancel in the prompt, because that returns a null, and null === '' is false, so it continues showing the prompt, but !null is true, so enters the if and breaks it.

Then Juan creates a lot of variables with country names: It has more sense to have one variable called countries, or names, or clients, depending on the case. Arrays go inside [] Square Brackets and it's divided by indexes. The first element of an array is at index 0, the second is at index 1, and so on ‚Äî and the last element is at the value of the array's length property minus 1. For example: <br>
                    var countries = ['Namibia', 'Malaysia', 'Myanmar', 'Gabon', 'Iceland', 'Nicaragua', 'Italy', 'Morocco', 'Mali', 'Svalbard & Jan Mayen'] <br>
                    If we show this in the console with console.log(countries) it will display the list numbered 0 to 9 with the same order of countries. Also we can put mix values, like, string, numbers, booleans, and different data, just as before the important is that it has sense and order. To see the quantity of countries we can use the property .length. Like this: <br>
                    console.log(countries.length). <br>
                    Now, to see an specific country we can write console.log(countries[0]).
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:26:00 to 1:30:00:</span> As the idea is to automitize all the processes, because we will be working with big data (for example 193 countries), we will create a repetitive structure, like a for. Like this:
                    for (var i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) { <br>
                        console.log('Index #' + i + ':', countries[i]); <br>
                    } <br>
                    Thus we can go over an array manually, with console.log(countries[0]), console.log(countries[1]), and so on; and automatically with the for (var i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++).

We can also put arrays inside another array, like this: First creating a variable and then calling it in console.log(objectNumber11[0]); console.log(objectNumber11[1]). But, we can also put straightforward console.log(objects[11][0]; that means from the index 11 the position 0. [] Square Brackets in JavaScript is always related with arrays.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:48:00 to 1:59:00:</span> The products example: var products = ['TV', 'Blender', 'Radio', 'Microwave', 'Mouse', 'Keyboard']. We can shoe it with console.log(products); console.dir(products); console.table(products). We can also see the length of the array using this: console.log('quantity of products:', products.length) and it will show in the console quantity of products: 6. But we can change the length assigning products.length = 3. That will show the first three elements. Then if we modify again length to 6, the final three index will be shown as empty. Hence we can modify the data inside an array by assigning new values, like this: products[1] = 'Toaster'; products[2] = 'Universal remote control'; they overwrite index 1 ('Blender') and index 2 ('Radio'). But generally we don't do that manually, as always we prefer to automatize things, adding it automatically.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:00:00 to 2:08:00:</span> For the above explained reason we use products.push: Like this: products.push('Stereo'); products.push('Speaker'); products.push('Electric kitchen'). That way .push adds new indexes at the end of the array and returns a new length (the number of arrays after the .push). Unlike .push we also have .pop to delete objects at the and of the array and returns the deleted object. It is like cutting with Ctrl + X. If we create a variable var element1Deleted = producs.pop(); we can see it with console.log('element1Deleted:', element1Deleted). Also, we can delete several elements at the same time: products.push('Stereo', 'Speaker', 'Electric kitchen') </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:08:00 to 2:09:00:</span> Arrays are very important because there are a lot of situations and ocassions where I will need to work with a lot of information or big data, and storing thing in an only place with indexes will make easier to go over it, to build lists of things.

                    <li><span class="hour">2:10:00 to 2:15:00:</span> As same as, or just as we can add and delete elements at the end of arrays, we can also do that at the begining.</li>

As we were in a queue the objects place in the order determined. So, if we add a new alement in the index 0, that element pass to be placed in index 1 and so on. We can also add several elements at the same time: products.unshift('Iron', 'Vacuum cleaner', 'Webcam'). Those elements will be add in the written order, so Iron index 0, Vaccum cleaner index 1 and Webcam index 2. Unshift, as same as .push returns the new array length. Finally shift, as .pop delete an element, but in the first position and returns the deleted value.</li>

                                while (i &lt; colors.length) { <br>
                                    console.log(colors[i]); <br>
                                    i++; <br>
                                } <br>
                            </li>

                                With a for  (automatically and shorter, ideal): <br>

                        But there is an even easier way to go over an array, using a for...of. <em>The for...of statement creates a loop iterating over iterable objects, including: built-in String, Array, array-like objects (e.g., arguments or NodeList), TypedArray, Map, Set, and user-defined iterables. It invokes a custom iteration hook with statements to be executed for the value of each distinct property of the object</em>. Like this: <br>
                        for (var x of colors) { <br>
                            console.log(x); <br>

It iterates the array and add the value to the designated variable, in this case x, but it could be called in different ways, so in the colors example, the variable shoul be called color (singular, or aColor), because the variable is storing the value return by the for...of. Like this:
                        for (var color of colors) { <br>
                            console.log(color); <br>
                        } <br>
                        That is like a "for each", that do the same, but works with callbacks. For...of will be used a lot.

                    'Marcela', <br>
                    ] <br>
                    We can show that: <br>
                    console.log(clients[0]); <br>
                    console.log(clients[0]); <br>

                    console.log(clients[2]); <br>
                    console.log(clients[3]); <br>
                    We already did that. Now we can have countries and its capitals: <br>
                    var capitals = [ <br>

Since element IDs are required to be unique if specified, they're a useful way to get access to a specific element quickly</em>. Come ways to create content with emmet abbreviations. First Juan creates some elements to identify it with ids. So, I will just make one example: <br>
                        &lt;p id="paragraph1"&gt;üêØ&lt;/p&gt;<br>
                    Inside the script tag or the JavaScript file we can do several things, like use console.log. Brief explanation and summary about object, properties and elements. So console is an object constituted by different parts .log; .warn; .error. Tha same is with the arrays var myArray = [1, 2]; myArray is an object with several functions, like .push (myArray.push()), (myArray.shift()), (myArray.unshift()); those area called methods, ¬øOK? They're functionalities of an object. Also the objects have properties like .length (myArray.length). So the objects allows as to access something after the point. In the same way document that represents the Webpage. It is also an object with different methods and getElementById is one of those. It's a function. So, for example if we write console in the console we're going to see how is build the console, its structure, with all its fucntions and properties, because console is an object. Well, document is another object that represents everything inside the !DOCTYPE and html tag. We can see document in the console using console.log(document), console.dir(document), console.table(document). So, getElementById is one the methods for document and for argument take the id of the element in the HTML. In our example it will be like this: <br>
                    document.getElementById('paragraph1') <br>
                    The above is a function that returns information. So we can save that data in a variable. For that, we create a variable related with the element, like this: <br>
                    var paragraph1Element = document.getElementById('paragraph1') <br>
                    Then we can now show it in the console with console.log('paragraph1Element'). Also we can access to attributes of the element and assign values, for example: <br>
                    paragraph1Element.title = 'Tiger' <br>
                    That statement adds a title to the paragraph. Take into account that tittle is a global attribute, that mean any element or tag can have a tittle. If we want to see the title of that element, after assign the variable to the document.getElementById method, we can write console.log('Title of paragraph 1', paragraph1Element.title). Also, we can modify the language assigning paragraph1Element.lang = 'en'.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">54:00 to 59:00:</span> When writing getElementById we can abbreviate document.gebi and press TAB. If we want to modify the element then, after store it in the variable we use the property innerHTML (innerHTML refers to the content within the tag or element). So we can write: <br>
                    paragraph1Element.innerHTML = ü¶Å and it will change the tiger face for a lion face. Also we can use .innerHTML to access to the content. This way: console.log('paragraph1Element.innerHTML:', paragraph1Element.innerHTML); and it will show the content within the HTML element. There is another method called textContent that works all the same but just shows the content without tags or HTML elements inside, it works if we just want to copy and paste, while on the other hand for a more elaborated and complex content taking into account the tags we use .innerHTML. If we want not just to modify but to add content we can use the following rule of code: <br>
                    paragraph1Element.innerHTML = paragraph1Element.innerHTML + 'Some more content'; <br>
                    We can abbreviate that with +=, like this: <br>
                    paragraph1Element.innerHTML =+ ' Some more content'; <br>
                    </li>

                    If we want to put the same content inside the element as a title we can assign, this way: <br>
                    paragraph1Element.title = paragraph1Element.innerHTML; <br>
                    Then the element title will be the same as the content inside the element. If we try to access to an inexistent element in the HTML, using .innerHTML we will receive the next error message in the console: <em>Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set properties of null (setting 'innerHTML') at index.html:41:39.</em>. It says null because the variable doesn't exist and in this case .innerHTML returns null and we cannot ask something to null.</strong>. Now, also, if we put in the HTML the element after the script tag, it will create again an error. The element should be located before the script tag. But we can put the tag top of the body and then program the script tag to work. But if is not configured we'll need to put the script on body's bottom.

                    Then we call it in JavaScript and store the data in a variable: <br>
                    var link1Element = document.getElementById('link1'); <br>
                    Once it's store in the variable we can access to the href attribute of the element with link1Element.href, and for example, show it in the console: <br>
                    console.log('link1Element.href:\n', link1Element.href) <br>
                    Also, we can put the method straightforward inside the console.log: <br>
                    console.log(document.getElementById('link1').href); <br>
                    This is possible but it is not a good idea, because not to store the element in a variable force the browser to search over and over for the same element, spending some more time. The idea is that browser look for the element just once.

                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:50:00 to 1:52:00:</span> To charge information from users we can use the property prompt, this way: <br>
                    nameElement.value = prompt('What is your name?'); <br>
                    For lastName we can do the same. <br>
                    lastNameElement.value = prompt('And your last name?');
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:52:00 to 1:59:00:</span> If we don't set events pop-ups, windows and code in general will be exacuted when refreshing the webpage. To program something like if the user clicks the OK bottom without information the input content says: "Not uploaded" we have to use a conditional, creating first a new variable called uploadedName and assigning the prompt('¬øWhat is your name?'). The we write the conditional, if uploadedName enter in the conditional and execute JS code nameElement.value = uploadedName, and if not (else), nameElement.value = 'Not uploaded'.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:59:00 to 2:11:00:</span> Now, if we want the last name part happens just when the user upload a name we also have to located within the if. The variable nameElement used to called the element by Id is used in the if and the else, for that reason have to be a global variable, but, the lastNameElement variable was created just for the if, so we can let it as a local variable. But if we want to show the content "Not uploaded" also in the last name input we need to put the lastName variable on top to convert it in a global variable and then put it with the assignment "Not uploaded". Like this: <br>
                    var nameElement = document.getElementById('name'); <br>
                    var lastNameElement = document.getElementById('lastName'); <br>
                    var uploadedName = propmt('¬øWhat is your name?'); <br>
                    If (uploadedName) { <br>
                        nameElement.value = uploadedName; <br>
                        lastNameElement.value = prompt('¬øAnd you lastName?'); <br>
                    } else { <br>
                        nameElement.value = 'Not uploaded'; <br>
                        lastNameElement.value = Not uploaded; <br>
                    } <br>
                    Now we can do this uploading 'Not uploaded' in the last name when the user do not add any name, creating a new variable lastUploadedName and by a nested if: <br>
                    If (uploadedName) { <br>
                        nameElement.value = uploadedName; <br>
                        var lastUploadedName = prompt('¬øAnd your last name?'); <br>
                        if(lastUploadedName){ <br>
                            lastNameElement.value = lastUploadedName; <br>    
                        } else { <br>
                            lastNameElement.value = Not uploaded; <br>
                        } <br>
                        lastNameElement.value = prompt('¬øAnd you lastName?'); <br>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:12:00 to 2:17:00:</span> This last example can be done by separate, this way: <br>
                    var nameElement = document.getElementById('name'); <br>
                    var uploadedName = prompt('¬øWhat is your name?'); <br>
                    if (uploadedName) { <br>
                        nameElement.value = uploadedName; <br>
                    } else { <br>
                        nameElement.value = 'Not uploaded'; <br>
                    } <br>
                    
                    var lastNameElement = document.getElementById('lastName'); <br>
                    var uploadedLastName = prompt('¬øWhat is your last name?'); <br>
                    if (uploadedLastName) { <br>
                        lastNameElement.value = uploadedLastName; <br>
                    } else { <br>
                        lastNameElement.value = 'Not uploaded'; <br>
                    } <br>
                    Juan's explanation about the last examples and their differences. The first one asks for a name and if the user upload a name, the asks by the last name, so name and last name are uploaded in the inputs if there are data. The separated examples ask for name and if it gets it upload the input, then ask for last name and if it gets it upload the input. 
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:18:00 to 2:20:00:</span> Finally we also can ask for name and last name at the same time, if both are gift they will be uploaded, but if not it will be shown "Incomplete" in both.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:21:00 to 2:22:00:</span> Farewell.</li>

                <h3>Timeline and notes Class 20.</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="hour">00:00 to 11:00:</span> Questions about methods of study, topics to study, comments about pensum IT education.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">12:00 to 15:00:</span> With getElementById we look for the HTML element to modify it, but if we can also programming things to occur when something happens, those are called events. According to the W3School <em>HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements. When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.</em></li>
                    <li><span class="hour">16:00 to 287:00:</span> The HTML attribute onclick that allows us to determine that something must happen when the user clicks that element, like this: &lt;div onclick="alert('You just click')" class="box"&gt;. Also there is ondblclick with the same functionality but double clicking the element. However this is not a good way to do that, it is not confortable and it is not recommended. <em>Important not to mix single quotes and doble quotes (single for JavaScript, double for HTML).</em>.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">28:00 to 41:00:</span> There are a lot of other events, just writing on... in javascripto we can find a lot of options, for example:
                        <ul>
                            <li>onmouseover: &lt;div onmouseover="console.log('You just entered the box with the cursor')" class="box"&gt;</li>
                            <li>onmouseout: &lt;div onmouseout="console.log('You just left the box with the cursor')" class="box"&gt;</li>
                            <li>onmousedown: &lt;div onmousedown="console.log('You press the button of the mouse')" class="box"&gt;</li>
                            <li>onmouseup: &lt;div onmouseout="console.log('You loose the button of the mouse')" class="box"&gt;</li>
                        </ul>
                    We can put both together: &lt;div onmouseover="console.log('You just entered the box with the cursor')" onmouseout="console.log('You just left the box with the cursor')" class="box"&gt;. In this long tags it is recommended to cut the line and indent the tags and the content within. In VS Code we have a line and column counter, and it is recommended not to exceed 80. Hence, we should cut the line with enter in a appropriate place, for example after the first statement. Div elements can be replace by paragraphs or other element and it will work all the same. That means those event attributes works for all HTML elements. The most commun event is just click. Onmousedown and onmouseup are useful when we want to do something when the cursor grabs an object or element and drops it somewhere. Double click is not as common as click, it could be used in more complex interfaces like Google Drive, or things like that, but it is not so common.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">42:00 to 48:00:</span> Placeholder attribute in inputs define a clue about the content it should be added to the input. Another HTML event attribute are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>oninput: &lt;input oninput="console.log('Input event');". When use types in the keyboard the console.log will show the string 'Input event', but it won't work for Ctrl, Shift and Alt keys, because they are usually accompanied by other keys. Delete and backspace do work and activate the console.</li>
                            <li>onkeydown: Reacts when press a key.</li>
                            <li>onkeyup: Reacts when release a key.</li>
                            <li>onchage: Reacts if we enter, modify and exit. Chage verify if the input is the same or has changes.</li>
                            <li>onfocus: It is activated when focus the element.</li>
                            <li>onblur: Reacts when the element looses the focus.</li>
                        </ul>
                        For more event example: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent" target="_blank">MDN MouseEvent</a>.
                        </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">49:00 to 50:00:</span> We can create a function in JavaScript called doThings: <br>
                    function doThings() { <br>
                        console.log('One thing'); <br>
                        console.warn('Another thing'); <br>
                        console.error('Some other thing'); <br>
                    } <br>
                    Then we create a button for Do things! and incorporate the attribute onclick adding the fuction doThings. So, when click in button console will show the messages programmed, like this: <br>
                    &lt;button onclick="doThings();"&gt;
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">51:00 to 59:00:</span> Assignment of functions. So, we have a declarative form of functions: function sum (num1, num2) {return num1 + num 2;}. But we also have de expresive form of functions: that is having a function and to assign it to a variable: var function1 = function () {};. Take into account that the typeof of function is function. Hence, we can write console.log(function1(10, 20)); and console will show the result 30. A more advanced form to do a sum function is: const sum = (a, b) =&gt; a + b; but we don't know yet how does it work.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:00:00 to 1:08:00:</span> In the case var newName = function sum (num1, num2) {return num 1 + num2}; we can not call the function sum, because when it's assigned into a new variable (newName), the function name is not already available. That way it is not necessary to use a functions name, so we dont' put the name sum and we let the function (num1, num2), that's called an anonymous function. Despite it is anonymous we can use it through the variable. Declarative functions are read by JavaScript engine as they were located on top of the file, it doesn't matter their location, that concept is called hoisting and is related with raising values to be available as they were in the top of code. <em>JavaScript Hoisting refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions, variables or classes to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code.</em> However if the variable assignment of the function is not executed yet the console.log won't work, because the variable doesn't exist.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:09:00 to 1:22:00:</span> Callbacks. They are function we put within another function as an argument. According to MDN definition <em>A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.</em> For example, we can create a function just to show a value and its type in the console, like this: function showInfo(value) {console.log('Recieved value:', value, '- Type:', typeof value);}. Then we can show that in the console showInfo(205); it will show Received value: 205 - type: number. Now we can create another function and store it in a variable, like var sayHello = function () {console.log(Hello!, I'm the sayHello function!);}. Then we put the variable sayHello inside the showInfo function and it will execute its value and typeof. Like this: showInfo(sayHello); or showInfo (funtion () {console.log(Hello!, I'm the sayHello function!);}</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:23:00 to 1:32:00:</span> What is the meaning that an argument is a function. Well, within a function we can't execute an argument like a number, string or boolean value as a function, we have to use a callback, otherwise it won't work. It is important that functions name refers to the funcionality of the function.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:32:00 to 1:42:00:</span> Check Callback: We can check if a function is a callback using the next lines of code:
                        function checkCallback(cb) { <br>
                            var type = typeof cb; <br>
                            if (type === 'function') { <br>
                                console.warn('Callback received'); <br>
                                cb(); <br>
                                console.warn('Callback executed'); <br>
                            } else { <br>
                                console.error('cb is not a function. Value received:', cb); <br>
                            } <br>
                        } <br>
                    Then we can use the function checkCallback as follows:
                    checkCallback(function () { console.log('Hola!'); }); checkCallback(function () { console.log('Qu√© tal?'); }); checkCallback(123);
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:42:00 to 1:44:00:</span> ¬øWhy are callbacks useful? Well the can be use to execute something in a determined time. For example: function executeIn3Seconds (fuctiontoexecute){functiontoexecute}; this is a callback created by us.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:44:00 to 1:47:00:</span> But we can also use callbacks functions incorporated in the browser, as setTimeout(callback, time). This is a method, like an alert, it is already created by the browser and receives two arguments: 1st a callback and 2nd time in milliseconds, like this: setTimeout(function(){}, 5000);. <strong>1000 milliseconds is the same as 1 second.</strong>. For example, we want the console to say 3 seconds have passed: setTimeout(function (){console.log('3 seconds have passed');}, 3000); <em>So, the global setTimeout() method sets a timer which executes a function or specified piece of code once the timer expires.</em></li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:47:00 to 1:53:00:</span> Another useful method is setInterval. <em>The setInterval() method, offered on the Window and Worker interfaces, repeatedly calls a function or executes a code snippet, with a fixed time delay between each call.</em> It will execute something every certain amount of time. It all need a callback and time. For example: setInterval(function (){ console.log('Tik, tok... üï∞Ô∏è');}, 1000); <strong><em>To cut an interval we use the method clearInterval(1);</em></strong> the number depends on the interval number or position line in JS. Well, setInterval return a number that represents the interval name, I can store that in a var idIntervalWatch = setInterval(function (){ console.log('Tik, tok... üï∞Ô∏è');}, 1000);.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:54:00 to 1:55:00:</span> To cut automatically the interval we can create a setTimeout and put inside a clearInterval(idIntervalWatch); like this: setTimeout(function () {console.warn('7 seconds have passed'); clearInterval(idIntervalWatch);}, 7000);</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:55:00 to 2:00:00</span> addEventListener is an event manager, according to MDN definition <em>the addEventListener() method of the EventTarget interface sets up a function that will be called whenever the specified event is delivered to the target.</em> so we have to put the event and then the callback we want to be executed when the event occurs, like this:
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>We create the variable:</b> var btnSayHelloElement = document.getElementById('btn-sayHello');</li>
                        <li><b>We change its content:</b> btnSayHelloElement.innerHTML = 'Say Hello';</li>
                        <li><b>We add the method:</b> btnSayHelloELement.addEventListener('click', function () {console.log('Hello bitches')}</li>
                    </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:01:00 to 2:11:00:</span> <strong>When the method getElementById does not find the element returns null</strong>. It is probable that when we create ids for the HTML elements they are like automatically created as variables in JS with the same names. If fact the are variable stored in an object called window, that we will talk about it later. Also in JS we can not use dashes as we do for ids in HTML.For that reason it is not recommended to name the variable as same as the HTML element, because we could be overwriting an automatically created variable. It is important to test if the code runs using console.log.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:11:00 to 2:22:00:</span> Take into account the word var inside a function because of the scope of functions. So next we will create an interactive button using getElementById and addEventListener:
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Create the button in HTML:</b> &lt;button id="btn-check-name"&gt;Check name &lt;/button&gt;</li>
                        <li><b>Call the element and store it in JS:</b> var btnCheckNameElement = document.getElementById('btn-check-name');</li>
                        <li><b>Create a global variable for the name:</b> var name;</li>
                        <li><b>Use the method addEventListener:</b> btnCheckNameElement.addEventListener('click', function () {});</li>
                        <li><b>Within the function add a prompt and assign its value to the var name:</b>{name = promt('¬øWhat is your name?')};</li>
                    </ol>
                    Also, we can create another interactive button to show the name if user charges one, like this:
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Create the button in HTML:</b> &lt;button id="btn-show-name"&gt;Show name &lt;/button&gt;</li>
                        <li><b>Call the element and store it in JS:</b> var btnshowNameElement = document.getElementById('btn-show-name');</li>
                        <li><b>Use the method addEventListener:</b> btnshowNameElement.addEventListener('click', function () {});</li>
                        <li><b>Within the function add a conditional if...else to indicate that if user adds a name it will show an alert with the name, else an alert with message "No name was uploaded":</b> {if (name) {alert(name);} else {alert('No name was upload');}</li>
                    </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:23:00 to 2:24:00:</span> Some comments about working with events and not just with console. Cousin's anecdote.</li>

So we're selecting them and calling them from the previuos selectiong of the document.getElementsByClassName('paragraphs-container')[0]; Another way to say this is once we have an HTMLCollection, we can filter any element inside it. There are other more confortable ways. But it is important to know it.</li>

It can't be set by assignment during execution, and it may be different each time the function is called.</em> To explain this, first a random example using addEventListener:
                        var mainHeader = document.getElementById('main-header');
                        mainHeader.addEventListener('click', function () {

                        But if we want to add that property to all h2 elements we create a h2Collection = document.getElementsByTagName('h2');  <br>
                        And then a for: <br>
                        for (var i = 0; i &lt; h2Collection; i++) {h2Collection[i].innerHTML = 'Click me!'; h2Collection[i].addEventListener('click', function (){console.log('h2 clicked'); mainHeader.innerHTML += 'üêæ';});} <br>
                        In this example the modification will be make in the main header, but if we want to do it in any h2 element or, another way to say it in any element of the h2Collection, we use the keyword "this". As in this example: instead of mainHeader.innerHTML += 'üêæ'; we replace by this.innerHTML += 'üêæ'; then when we click in any h2 element it will be add footprints.

Another way to find elements through javascript is querySelector, it enables to find coincidences like child elements and other rare things. It'll be seen later. Typically we use getElementsByTagName when we need to modify or programing a secuence of elements related, so we have them qualified, but if we need to modify just one element we usally use ids.</li>

                    The best thing to do is using ids, but we wont put ids to everything to work with JavaScript. Instead of create classes like paragraph-border-left is better to use just border-left, or bg-gold instead of background-gold. Remembering += operator, HTMLCollections,

                    </ol>
                    Style management from JavaScript is used to provide interactivity, for example reacting to events, to put it gray because it turns off, to add or remove styles. Take into account that compound property names should be in camelCase, it's not possible to use -, because it is a mathematical operator, for example textAlign instead text-align, fontFamily instead font-family, fontSize instead font-size. Adding styles with JavaScript is like putting inline CSS in HTML elements. We always have to put th style property to add a new CSS style.

                                <li>Create and program another button to hide the element. For that purpose we create another button within the warning to hide it, adding the event: btnHideInfo.addEventListener('click', function () {importantWarning.style.diplay = 'none';}</li>

According to MDN <em>the Element.classList is a read-only property that returns a live DOMTokenList collection of the class attributes of the element.</em>. We can create a variable calling an id element: var p1 = document.getElementById('paragraph1'); then with p1.classList shows in console DOMTokenList. Also, we can use p1.classList.add(); to add a new class; p1.classList.remove(); to remove a class.</li>

Example: firstH1.classList.add('highlighted'); We can add two or more classes to the same element applying the property twice, so we can then write firstH1.classList.add('textAlignCenter'); they both will be added at the same time. We can also add them in one line like this: firstH1.classList.add('highlighted', 'textAlignCenter');</li>

According to MDN <em>the toggle() method of the DOMTokenList interface removes an existing token from the list and returns false. If the token doesn't exist it's added and the function returns true.</em> In other words it adds a class if there is not one in the element or removes it if there is one. Example: firstH1.classList.toggle('highlighted'); now, we can force the addition of the class with the word true, like this: firstH1.classList.toggle('highlighted', true); or forcefully remove it with false firstH1.classList.toggle('highlighted', false);. An example of use is:
                    <ul>
                        <li>var addingClass = confirm('Do you want to change the class?');</li>

                    </ul>
                    It can also be used for give style to elements when the user clicks, using methods like addEventListener kind of thing.

                    <li><span class="hour">1:46:00 to 2:08:00:</span> Accordions. Well, first creating some HTML elements with emmet: article*4&gt;h3&gt;lorem4^div&gt;p*2&gt;loren20. Most of the code used in accordion is CSS and HTML, and just a little bit of JavaScript. Explanation about BEM, BEM proposal is to create block sets with element within. Example: nav with the class="bodyNav", logo inside the nav class="bodyNav__logo". Another examples in <a href="https://9elements.com/bem-cheat-sheet/" target="_blank">https://9elements.com/bem-cheat-sheet/</a>. In this Webpage we see the example of cards. Some more information abput BEM (Block, Element, Modifier), and how all functions as just one element or set of elements.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:09:10 to 2:30:00:</span> Going back to the accordiona example and the use of emmet to create HTML content: article.accordion__item*8&gt;h3.accordion__item-title&gt;lorem4^div.accordion__item-content&gt;p*2&gt;lorem20. Then giving style to the elements with CSS using the classes. It is recommended to paint the elements with contrast background colors to see their behaviour and then clean the elements. More style with CSS, margin bcg-color, border, max-width, width (vw, vh, %), padding. Recommendations about the use of colors and HSL tool. Google Chrome generates a little border when showing the Webpage in elements like tables or lists, that's a browser issue, in Firefox that little border doesn't appear. Finding a 2 colors palette in <a href="https://coolors.co/" target="_blank">coolors.co</a></li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:30:00 to 2:40:00</span> Then we can add the property display with the value none to hide element with class accordion__item-content and we can add a hover to the elements with class accordion__item-title, very smooth, just the necessary to highligh them a little bit. To show the hand in the cursor when it pass over the titles we add the property cursor with the value pointer. To add hover to an element within a container: .accordion__item:hover .accordion__item-title {background-color: hsl(287. 43%, 20%);}. We create the class accordion__item--open with display: block and set display:none by default for class .accordion_item--content</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:40:00 to 2:44:00:</span> With JavaScript we can call the classes: var accordionItems = document.getElementsByClassName('accordion__item'); and then adding an accion when click with addEventListener within a for:
                    <ol>
                        <li>for (var i = 0; i &lt; accordionItems.lenght; i++) {}</li>
                        <li>Inside the for: accordionItems[i]addEventListener('click', function () {this.classList.toggle('accordion__item--open')});</li>
                    </ol>
                    This way the for adds or removes the class accordion__item--open with the property display:block when the user clicks the element, showing or hidding the content.

                    <li><span class="hour">41:00 to 42:00:</span> Ternary operator. <em>The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark (?), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon (:), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy. This operator is frequently used as an alternative to an if...else statement.</em></li>
                    <li><span class="hour">43:00 to 50:00:</span> Ternary is used to replace if and else with the same variable. Like this:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Assign an empty variable: var message = '';</li>
                        <li>Assign another: var language = 'es';</li>
                        <li>Apply the conditional: if (language === 'es') {message = 'Hola!';}</li>
                        <li>Add an else: else {message = 'Hello!';}</li>
                        <li>console.log(message);</li>
                    </ol>
                    The ternary in this case will create to different values to the same variable from a determined condition. So it will be like this:
                    <ol>
                        <li>message = (language === 'es') ? 'Hola!' : 'Hello!';</li>
                        <li>console.log(message);</li>
                    </ol>
                    The ternary is asking if the expression in the left of the exclamation sign (?) is true assign 'Hola', else (:) assign 'Hello!'. In other word a ternary is like: <em>variable = condition ? 'value if true' : 'value if false';</em>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">51:00 to 1:22:00:</span> Lazy loading, emphasis in the use and meaning of ternary. Another ternary example with a discount:
                    <ol>
                        <li>var withDiscount = (boolean, can be true or false);</li>
                        <li>var price = 200;</li>
                        <li>console.log('Total: ')</li>
                        <li>console.log(withDiscount ? price * 0.8 : price);</li>
                    </ol>
                    Ternary can be use in rare and unexpected ways, it can work but is not commun use. Some other examples of rare uses of ternary. If possible not do something like this:
                    <ol>
                        <li>var trueValue = 'Initial value';</li>
                        <li>var falseValue = 'Initial value';</li>
                        <li>Rare ternary (don't do it like this): true ? trueValue = 'A' : falseValue = 'B';</li>
                    </ol>
                    In th assignation we don't put a new variable, we just don't do that, it's hard to understand. It 's better to use an if...else. Instead of a wear ternary like balance &gt; 20000 ? console.log('You can buy') : console.error('Insufficient balance'); use an if...else:
                    <ol>
                        <li>if (balance &gt; 20000) {console.log('You can buy')}</li>
                        <li>else {console.error('Insufficient balance');}</li>
                    </ol>
                    It's easier to read. We can skip the brackets but it is not recommended, without the proper use of the comma, the expressions after the first one can be displayed in the console.

                    <li><span class="hour">03:00 to 34:00:</span>Basic form. HTML defines the structure and interactivity is determined by a programming language. All forms will be contained within a form tag. Input is an empty tag and it puts an space where users can add information. They're like generic boxes and they're line elements. Labels are like stickets. We can get within the label the input, but it brings problems with CSS, to give separated style to both elements. Also, we can link labels and inputs using for in label and id in input. This is useful for accesibility. Now to check if it works we click the label and automatically should be active the input. By default inputs have the attribute type: text, if we change the type by "submit" it will send information: input type="submit". The text in the input "submit" appears in the same language of the Operative System. We also have the attribute value to add an initial content within the input: input value="Ernesto". It works like a charged information than we can change after. Instead placeholder attribute is like a hint to help users what type of content they should add. Users can't change the placeholder text. Placeholder should never be used as a replacement for labels. It's a rookie mistake. Value attribute overwrites the placeholder attribute. We can change the value of the submit button with the value attribute: input type="submit" value="Send". The form is not finished until we establish an action attribute, that defines the landing page where it will be send the data, for example: form action="search.html".For the data to be organized in the landing page we have to name the inputs with the attribute name: input id="user" name="user" and input name="email" id="email" placeholder="usuario@mail.com" value="ernesto111@gmail.com". <strong>It is an important work that name does, and we have to take into account that it is name who send and organize the information in server, not ids, that's another rookie mistake</strong>. We can see how name works with the browser direction bar. Hence, when we add data to the inputs with name attributes it generates a particular direction declaring the sent data, like this: http://127.0.0.1:5501/01-basic-form/search.html ? user=eroca&emailernesto111%40gmail.com We can see there how is divided the direction by the question sign ?, so information in left is the direction where inputs are stored and information rifght is the data stored. The ampersand sign separates any new datum added. This is in fact a form created to ask for data not to post data. To define the send form we have to use the attribute method. That attribute is set by default with the value get method="get", and if we want to post then we just have to change that value: form action="search.html" method="post". It is recommended to use always English words for attributes like for, id, name. The name of the input should be the same word of the label. For example label user; input name="user", label article input name="article", if I use in this last example input name="prouct" it can create confusion. Placeholder is a new attribute of HTML. Some questions about the difference between get and post, and what's better to use input or button. Comments about validations, comments about methods or verbs get, post, put delete and others in the back-end are used as an API (Application Programming Interface).</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">35:00 to 51:00:</span> Search form:
                    <ol>
                        <li>1st the tag form: form action="https://google.com/search" target="_blank"</li>
                        <li>2nd the tag label: label for="search"</li>
                        <li>3th the input: input type="Search" id="search"</li>
                        <li>4th an input to submit the data: input type="submit" value="search"</li>
                    </ol>
                    The attribute type search indicates the browser that the input is a search input and browser put a cross (X) in the right extreme of the input to delete all the information typed or by clicking escape, it's cool and practical and specific for search inputs. If we want to make appear th cross in another form we should programm it. Comments about <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/input-group/" target="_blank">inputs group in bootstrap</a> and <a href="https://fontawesome.com/" target="_blank">font awesome</a> to create buttons. In search inputs when enter is like press the submit button. <strong>To make an input required we add that attribute: input type="search" id"search" placeholder="Ej: foot lamp" required.</strong> Just when users adds something in that input they would be able to send the form. Required has no value, we just declare the attribute and period. Another attribute is autofocus: input type="search" id"search" placeholder="Ej: foot lamp" required autofocus to help the user to focus the cursor in the form and input at the correct place. To send the data to google, we have to put google direction and name the form with q, that's required by google. That q stands for query.

                            <li>Put all labels and inputs inside div elements (block elements) to position every label and input one above another. So, first he creates a div tag above the label tags</li>
                            <li>Put the cursors in the closing tag of the div elements and keeping Alt Press + Down Arrow he locates the close tag below the inputs.</li>

                        </ol>
                        Then adding some margin to the div elements and label display: block. Not recommended to use br or p tags because they're not paragraphs. In the same page the tutor creates an input type="submit" value="Register" and another one input type="reset" value="Reset the form".
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:07:00 to 1:20:00:</span> Now play a little with required.

Another option is to create an span tag and use the property vertical-align: .mandatory {vertical-align: super;} vertical-align has other values, as top, baseline and others. If we want that determine a minimum length to the input we can use the attribute minlenght within the input: input type="text" id="name" name="name" autofocus value="Ernesto" required minlenght="2". To turn off the autocomple in the tag form we put autocomplete="off": form action="register.html" autocomplete="off". Also we can use maxlength="20". For emails input we can use input type="email", that way it needs an email structure with an at sign (@).
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:21:00 to 1:24:00:</span> JavaScript strict mode comments. To activate we have to type within the script: 'use strict'; For telephone inputs: input type="tel" id="telephone" name="telephone".</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:25:00 to 1:37:00:</span> For nationality inputs we can use a select or a list. input type="text" id="nationality" name="nationality" list="countries-list". In another tag we'll have the datalist. That is an element hidden for user that allows to develop a list of option elements. We put the option elements between the datalist open and closure tag: &lt;datalist&gt;&lt;/datalist&gt;<em>The option tag defines an option in a select list, but you usually need the value attribute, which indicates what is sent to the server on form submission.</em>. We can use option tag with the closure &lt;option&gt;&lt;/option&gt; for the select element and without the tag closure for &lt;option&gt;&lt; with the attributte value. We linked the datalist with the input putting the same list value in the datalist id:
                    <ul>
                        <li>&lt;datalist id="countries-list"&gt;</li>
                        <li>&lt;option value="Germany"&gt;</li>
                        <li>&lt;option value="Argentina"&gt;</li>
                        <li>&lt;option value="Brasil"&gt;</li>
                        <li>&lt;option value="Chile"&gt;</li>
                        <li>&lt;option value="Colombia"&gt;</li>
                        <li>&lt;/datalist&gt;</li>
                    </ul>
                    Then it appears the differente options inside the input. The VS Code notifies errors for not to close the option tags, but when checking the HTML in <a href="https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input" target="_blank">validator.3.org</a> shows no error or warning, that's because before it was consider an error, but not anymore. Any browser shows a different style for the lists. It's for example different Firefox from Chrome. Now select is different. In this tag option elements goes between an open and close select tag:
                    <ul>
                        <li>&lt;select id="nationality" name="nationality"&gt;</li>
                        <li>&lt;option&gt;Germany&lt;/option&gt;</li>
                        <li>&lt;option&gt;Argentina&lt;/option&gt;</li>
                        <li>&lt;option&gt;Brasil&lt;/option&gt;</li>
                        <li>&lt;option&gt;Chile&lt;/option&gt;</li>
                        <li>&lt;option&gt;Colombia&lt;/option&gt;</li>
                        <li>&lt;/select&gt;</li>
                    </ul>
                    With select we can not type, just to choose the option. Also we have to put the a name and an id, ass we do with an input. The datalist tag can be more flexible than select, and it can be use for more flexible data, more for suggesting words to users.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:37:00 to 1:48:00:</span> Now, in general we add a number code any option, for send the number instead of the name of the country, so the example before will be like this:
                    <ul>
                        <li>&lt;select id="nationality" name="nationality"&gt; size="10" multiple</li>
                        <li>&lt;option value="1"&gt;Germany&lt;/option&gt;</li>
                        <li>&lt;option value="2"&gt;Argentina&lt;/option&gt;</li>
                        <li>&lt;option value="3"&gt;Brasil&lt;/option&gt;</li>
                        <li>&lt;option value="4"&gt;Chile&lt;/option&gt;</li>
                        <li>&lt;option value="5" selected&gt;Colombia&lt;/option&gt;</li>
                        <li>&lt;/select&gt;</li>
                    </ul>
                    The order of the numbers can change as we add new options. If we want a option to be selected by default we can add the attribute selected. Besides, with the attriute size in the open tag select we can determine how many options we want to be visible and with multiple we allow to choose several options.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:49:00 to 1:51:00:</span> Another example of data list with the input:
                    <ul>
                        <li>&lt;datalist id="interests-list"&gt;</li>
                        <li>&lt;option value="Lawyer"&gt;</li>
                        <li>&lt;option value="Programming"&gt;</li>
                        <li>&lt;option value="Web"&gt;</li>
                        <li>&lt;option value="Philosophy"&gt;</li>
                        <li>&lt;option value="Engineering"&gt;</li>
                        <li>&lt;option value="Medicine"&gt;</li>
                        <li>&lt;option value="Sports"&gt;</li>
                        <li>&lt;option value="Music"&gt;</li>
                        <li>&lt;label for="interests-area"&gt;Interests area&lt;/label&gt;</li>
                        <li>&lt;input type="text" id="interests-area" name="interests-area" list="interests-list"&gt;</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:52:00 to 2:05:00:</span> For gender inputs, and in general for not to many options it is often use radius and it is also use to put first the input and then the label tag:
                    <ul>
                        <li>&lt;fieldset&gt;</li>
                        <li>&lt;legend&gt;Gender&lt;/legend&gt;</li>
                        <li>&lt;input type="radio" id="femenine" name="gender" value="f"&gt;</li>
                        <li>&lt;label for="gender"&gt;Feminine&lt;/label&gt;</li>
                        <li>&lt;input type="radio" id="masculine" name="gender" value="m" checked&gt;</li>
                        <li>&lt;label for="gender"&gt;Masculine&lt;/label&gt;</li>
                        <li>&lt;input type="radio" id="other" name="gender" value="o"&gt;</li>
                        <li>&lt;label for="gender"&gt;Other&lt;/label&gt;</li>
                        <li>&lt;/fieldset&gt;</li>
                    </ul>
                    To properly communicate the information to the server we must add a value to realize which input was selected by the user. Otherwise  the bar address will say gender=on, but when we add the value f, m or o the address bar says gender=f, m o o, depending on the user's choice. As with other inputs we can add the attribute required. <strong>We use the fieldset tag to agroup all the inputs related with the gender and with the legend tag we can write a name for that group</strong>. The fieldset tag generates a box, but we can change it we CSS. If we want one of the element to be marked we can use the attribute checked, but it strongly not recommended to put checked in a gender input, it has no sens.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:05:00 to 2:12:00:</span> For Zip Code inputs we can use regular expressions with the attribute pattern, it's horrible, utterly horrible, but fascinating.
                    <ul>
                        <li>&lt;label for="zip-code"&gt;Zip Code&lt;/label&gt;</li>
                        <li>&lt;input type="text" id="zip-code" name="zip-code" pattern="[0-9]{5,6}" placeholder="Ex: 20300, 308004&gt;</li>
                    </ul>
                    In placeholder we put examples, not the text. <a href="https://www.html5pattern.com/" target="_blank">HTML5Patterns.com</a> is a page to copy and paste different pattern we want to use for names, passwords, cards, postal codes, dates, phones, emails, colors, miscs.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:13:00 to 2:19:00:</span> For age we use an input with type number:
                        <ul>
                            <li>&lt;label for="age"&gt;Age&lt;/label&gt;</li>
                            <li>&lt;input type="number" id="age" name="age" max="120" min="18"&gt;</li>
                        </ul>
                    We can set the min and max number. Do not confuse with minlength and maxlength, those are for the number of characters. Min and max are just for numeric characters. Now with the attribute step we can set use of decimals. For example for height:
                        <ul>
                            <li>&lt;label for="heigth"&gt;Height (meters)&lt;/label&gt;</li>
                            <li>&lt;input type="number" id="heigth" name="heigth" max="2" min="0.5" step=".1"&gt;</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:20:00 to 2:23:00</span> The example of the country code number, something that Google do using list elements. It's all a big lie what we see in internet.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:24:00 to 2:29:00:</span> For observations or comments we will use a textarea tag:
                        <ul>
                            <li>&lt;label for="observations"&gt;Observations&lt;/label&gt;</li>
                            <li>&lt;textarea id="observations" name="observations" minlength="10"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;</li>
                        </ul>
                        Textarea has no type and no value. With CSS we can select the tag textarea and define that width: 500px; height: 100px; resize: none (to avoid the change in the size), or resize: horizontal (only can be change horizontally), or resize: vertical. Also with textarea we can use the attribute rows="5" or cols="10", but they're not to much use.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:29:00 to 2:39:00:</span> Button tag unlike input tag opens and close: &lt;button&gt;&lt;/button&gt;. When we put a button tag within a form it sends the form data to the server. By default button has the type="submit", so we don't need to declare that attribute. If we put the type button, it does nothing unless we set it. The button type reset is used to reset the form. The inputs with type button also do nothing (unless we use addEventListener and set an event). As button tag opens and closes, that means we can put an image inside. In inputs we just can use emojis. <a href="https://emojipedia.org/" target="_blank">For emojis research emojipedia.org</a> Emojis can change depending on the browser or application, for example telephones can be very different one from another. To find images for buttons we can look in <a href="https://www.iconfinder.com/" target="_blank">iconfinder.com</a>. Now inside the text within the button tag we can also add elements like strong, em, b and other. That's not possible with input, because we can not add styles to the values inside inputs. Example of button:
                        <ul>
                            <li>&lt;button type="submit"&gt;</li>
                            <li>&lt;img src="img/send.png" alt="send"&gt;</li>
                            <li>&lt;/button&gt;</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:40:00:</span> To add files, input type="file", and also there are other inputs like inputs type color, and other to see. Farewell.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li><span class="hour">00:00 to 08:00:</span> Form to send files: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>&lt;form action="process.php" enctype="multipart/form-data"&gt;</li>
                            <li>&lt;label for="cv"&gt;CV&lt;/label&gt;</li>
                            <li>&lt;input type="file" name="cv" id="cv"&gt;</li>
                            <li>&lt;/form&gt;</li>
                        </ul>
                        The attribute enctype="multipart/form-data" is needed when we are working with files. If we want the input to accept images ad pdf we can add the attribute accept="image/*,.pdf", as we can find in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file" target="_blank">MDN Input type file</a>. Now, for pictures we can use the following form:
                        <ul>
                            <li>&lt;form action="process.php" enctype="multipart/form-data"&gt;</li>
                            <li>&lt;label for="pictures"&gt;Pictures&lt;/label&gt;</li>
                            <li>&lt;input type="file" name="pictures" id="pictures" multiple&gt;</li>
                            <li>&lt;/form&gt;</li>
                        </ul>
                        We use the attribute multiple to allow user to add more than one pictures at a time.
                        </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">08:00 to 14:00:</span> As was said before <strong>form tags has the method="get" by default and are use when we are searching, asking or looking for information. To upload file, to register, to log in or to publish something we have to change the form method="post".</strong>. With method="get" all the information shared to the server appears in the addres bar, however with method="post" anything appears in the address bar and creates a different error. With get all the information about the form appears in the address bar. But eventually we won't be able to send an infinite quantity of information, it's limited. The method get has a limit related with the maximum lenght for addresses determined by each browser. With get we can't send images. When we put the method post we won't see anything in the address bar, but the page will receive the information.

                    With scope we determine if a table heading is a column or a row.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">33:00 to 1:00:00:</span> Some styles to the table with CSS. Tables are block elements, border-spacing: 5px, border, margin, width, tag caption, tbody th, color, background-color, empty-cells: show, empty-cells: hide (it doesn't work with border-collapse: collapse).</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:00:00 to 1:25:00:</span>More styles to the table. Property border-collapse: collapse (border-collapse has value "separate" by default), width, max-width, #table3 th {font-family, font-weight, <b>font-variant: small-caps</b>}, applying classes in th we can add a background-color to the hd rows (vertical). If we increase the size of any cell it will increase the size of the entire column. Use of border-radius in caption. If we add border-radius in the whole table the borders in the bottom cells can be affected negativelly by border-collapse and in its borders, for that reason it's better to use border-radius just in the caption table. We can also apply pseudoclasses: #table3 tr:hoover {background-color: blue;}. If we want the th row also change we add the following pseudoclass: #table3 tr .dark:hoover {background-color: black;}, or #table3 tr:hoover .dark {background-color: black;}. Do not exagerate with this effects.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:26:00 to 1:47:00:</span> To let cells fixed like in excel we have to use position. Juan made a table to show how to merge cells vertically and horizontally: colspan and rowspan within the td tag and erase the next cells occupied. The cell's displacement is always to the right.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:48:00 to 1:51:00:</span> For vertical alignment we put a class="top-text" and in CSS with .top-text {} we can use properties as vertical-align: baseline; vertical-align: bottom; vertical-align: middle (by default); vertical-align: text-top;</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:51:00 to 2:21:00:</span> Applying more styles to the table using color palettes in coolors.com and properties as text-align, margin, border, border-collapse: collapse, background-color, oadding, border-bottom. Some questions. Naming the AJAX techniques <em>which allows you to update parts of the DOM of an HTML page without the need for a full page refresh. Ajax also lets you work asynchronously, meaning your code continues to run while the targeted part of your web page is trying to reload (compared to synchronously, which blocks your code from running until that part of your page is done reloading).</em> Explanation of hard code, <em>meaning something that you want to embed with your program or any project that can not be changed directly. For example, if you are using a database server, and hard code to connect your database with your project, then that can not be changed by the user</em>. To add data automatically into a table we'll need a structure like a for () {} and within it to program the addition of object to an array to form the table.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:23:00 to 2:31:00</span> Tables can have other elements within, tags like p, em, strong, b, h1, img, ul>li, even another table tag. Layout with tables is not a good practice because of the semantic. Use of canvas and svg to use images in tables.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:32:00 to 2:39:00:</span> <strong>In a window the viewport is all the available zone for HTML elements.</strong> width: 40vw; heigth: 20vw, font-size: 5vw. To define 1vw is equivalent to define 1% of the viewport width and to define 1vh is equivalent to defin 1% of the viewport heigth.</li>

                <h3>Timeline and notes Class 27.</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="hour">00:00 to 12:00:</span> <strong>1 rem = root element (HTML) font-size. When font-size is not defined it's, usually, 16px.</strong> Some examples: width: 50rem = width: 800px.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">12:00 to 25:00:</span><strong>1 em = 1 time the container element font-size. When font-size is not defined in the element it takes the inherited font-size from his container element.</strong> Hence if we have nested lists and we use em to the nested li elements we can generate an effect of increment or decrement of size. The container element font-size is tipically in pixels or in a fixed unit.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">25:00 to 27:00:</span>Rem is simpler to use than em, but it depends on the HTML font-size, and em is interesting because if we use em in all elements everything can be proportionally changed changing the container font-size. Both are plenty use in coding at the same time.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">28:00 to 35:00:</span> Regularly we use pixels when we don't what that size depends on other elements size. Pixels are good to define shadows or border-radius.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">36:00 to 47:00:</span>Background properties. Element img is a semantic element brings information about somenthing specific. It's not decorative, it helps users to understand the information. If the image has a decorative purpose we should use background-image properties in CSS. Elements img has a place in the HTML code, but background-images are located backwards of the elements. For background-images we can use absolute or relative urls. So we have to take into account that the url comes from the CSS file where are calling the image, for example: background-image: url('../img/ocean.jpg'). It is recommended to use for the same box, container or element apply a background-color with a similar color to the background-image in case this one doesn't work. It's useful colorcop.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">48:00 to 49:00:</span> With the property background-repeat we define if the image repeats or not: background-repeat: no-repeat; background-repeat: repeat-x; background-repeat: repeat-y; background-repeat; repeat (to repeat the image in all directions).</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">50:00 to 1:15:00:</span> With background-attachement we define if the image will stay fixed or if it will move with the scroll (this is the default value), so background-attachement: scroll; background-attachement: fixed. With fixed value the image is located in the top left corner of the viewport, for that reason it's important to set the property background-repeat: repeat-y with the background-attachement: fixed. Other properties are background-size: 200px; background-position: 140px 30px; the first value set the x value and the second the y value. Also with background-position we can use words like top, left, right, bottom and center: background-position: 20px bottom; background-position: bottom center. When one word is missed the default value of the next one is center. It doesn't matter the order of the words. THe property background-size also can be set with x and y values, like: background-size: 300px 70px; background-size: auto 300px; or others like background-size: contain, hence the image will be as big as the container; background-size: cover; covers all the container space with the image. Background images are located by default top left of the container, so if we change the background-position: top right and set the background-size: cover the behaviour of the image when gets smaller or bigger will be related with this new position. If we set background-size: 50%; means that the image will have a 50% width size of the container element. It's not recommended to allow an image to stretch when resized, at least we're working with textures or images that hid in a certain way the stretch defects.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:15:00 to 1:35:00:</span> Multiple backgrounds, that means to put in one container several background images at the same time. Example son, grass, montain and clouds backgrounds to create a pretty beautiful and dinamic background for a webpage. To see more <a href="/clase27/03-fondos-multiples/index.html" target="_blank">Class 27: 03 - Multiple Backgrounds</a></li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:35:00 to 1:51:00:</span> Fixed backgrounds. Juan uses a series of sections, each of them with backround images and set them to have a pretty good efect of fixed bacgrounds. To see the page example visit: <a href="/clase27/04-fondos-fijos/index.html" target="_blank">Class 27: 04 - Fixed backgrounds</a> and check the code with VS Code. Some notes about thigns said by Juan: property line-height: 2.5rem works for separate lines in a paragraph. Other effects used are parallax in which background images move in different speed when scroll.

                    <li><span class="hour">1:52:00 to 2:20:00:</span> Property box-shadow, according to MDN Web Docs <em>adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects separated by commas. A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color.</em> Take into account shadows has no color, but for practical and graphic purpose we consider they're black. So we stablihed a black color with an alfa value transparent. Hence the third value represents the blur-radius for the shadow:
                    /* offset-x | offset-y | blur-radius | color */ box-shadow: 10px 5px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, .3); a fourth value determines the shadow size. Now we can apply several shadows to an box and create visual effects. An additional shadow can be more realistic. The value inset put the shadow inside the box: box-shadow: inset 10px 5px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, .3); to create the feeling of volume in a box we can apply the following code: box-shadow: inset 4px 4px 7px rgba(0, 0, 0, .3), -1px -1px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, .3), 1px 1px rgba(255, 255, 255, .4). They idea to make shadows is to use internet tools, like:

                    <li><span class="hour">2:20:00 to 2:31:00:</span> Property text-shadow, according to MDN <em> text-shadow adds shadows to text. It accepts a comma-separated list of shadows to be applied to the text and any of its decorations. Each shadow is described by some combination of X and Y offsets from the element, blur radius, and color. It' almost the same as box shadow but doesn't allow to do all things we can do with box-shadow. It means is more limited and easier to work with.</em>.

Objects are data structures formed by other data structures. Languages as Java and JavaScript are full of objects. Not all elements in JavaScript are objects, for example the primitive data, number, strings, booleans, undefined, null (with type of null is declared as an object but this is a JavaScript bug). So example of objects are:

                    console.log('logged 3:', newCourse.logged[3]); In this moment came up that when arrays are treat like strings, for example when putting the in an alert, values stick together, because text transform the info in strings or text to show it in the window. </li>

What's the difference between them I found by my self that the form firstName: 'Monica' is a data property, but we also can use get getName() {return this.firstName;} and that is called accessor property(getter). In this last case a getter method getName() is created to access the property of an object. To create a getter method, the get keyword is used. And also when accessing the value, we access the value as a property: student.getName;. The object is const student:
                        const student = {

                            // data property
                            firstName: 'Monica',
                            
                            // accessor property(getter)
                            get getName() {
                                return this.firstName;
                            }
                        }; Hence, when you try to access the value as a method, an error occurs: console.log(student.getName()); // error.

                    <li><span class="hour">1:53:00 to 2:01:00:</span> "This" is an especial word that helps us to set that we what the function to refer to the same object it is working on. So in an objectc user1, instead of code the method toPresent: function () {console.log(`Soy ${user1.nombre} ${user1.apellido}`); we replace user1 by this and put toPresent: function () {console.log(`Soy ${this.nombre} ${this.apellido}`); THe meaning of "this" depends on where is it located.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:01:00 to 2:10:00:</span>When creating method inside an object and in functions in general if we name the function or method get...something usually is because returns something. Hence keeping in the example above we can define a method getCompleteName: function () { return `${this.nombre} ${this.apellido}`;} With this set, now we can put the method getCompleName within the method toPresent: toPresent: function () {console.log(`Soy ${this.getCompleName()`);</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:10:00 to 2:36:00:</span> In general objects have some repetitive properties that we can short, because is commun they have a same behaviour for example in a web store of products. For better create a list of objects we use builder functions. An example of builder function is:
                        function similConstructora (id, name, lastName, email) {
                            var obj = {};
                            obj.id = id;
                            obj.completeName = name + ' ' + lastName;
                            obj.name = name;
                            obj.lastName = lastName;
                            obj.email = email;
                            // console.log(obj);
                            return obj;
                        } Then we can add a new object assigning the name and values var usuario1 = similConstructora(1840, 'Carolina', 'Romero', 'caro1@gmail.com');
                        The problem in this case is to add methods, because obj.compleName = name + ' ' + lastName; won't work when we add new names and last names. So we could add a function within the object obj.getNombreCompleto = function () { return this.nombre + ' ' + this.apellido };
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:36:00 to 2:40:00:</span> After a not to clear explanation the tutor explains and give an example about a real builder function:
                        function Usuario (id, nombre, apellido, email) {
                            this.id = id;
                            this.getNombreCompleto = function () { return this.nombre + ' ' + this.apellido };
                            this.nombre = nombre;
                            this.apellido = apellido;
                            this.email = email;
                        }
                        Too assign new objects we have to use the word new, and in order to apply them in the object, not in windows we use the word "this" in any property and method. For example: var usuario1 = new Usuario(1840, 'Carolina', 'Romero', 'caro1@gmail.com');
                        var usuario2 = new Usuario(2530, 'Ver√≥nica', 'Morelli', 'veromorelli@gmail.com');
                        var usuario3 = new Usuario(1855, 'Marcos', 'Pascual', 'mpascual1212@gmail.com');
                        var usuario4 = new Usuario(7029, 'Lorena', 'S√°nchez', 'loooore@gmail.com'); <strong>Finally, a builder function doesn't need to be initialized in uppercases, but it's frecuent to do that to differentiate it from other functions.</strong>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            function Product (name, brand, category, price, stock) {
                                this.name = name;
                                this.brand = brand;

                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    To add/assign products:
                    <ul>
                        <li> var product1 = new Product('TV Bravia LZ-5500', 'Sony', 'Smart TV', 59300, 12);</li>
                        <li>var product2 = new Product('Rollers W500', 'Rollerblade', 'Rollers', 42700, 5);</li>
                        <li>var product3 = new Product('Chromecast', 'Google', 'Multimedia', 21400, 10);</li>
                    </ul>
                    Any product is an object and any object is called "instance" (<i>espa√±ol: "instancia"</i>). It is common to call the builder patterns from another file. Builder patterns are so much use in any system where we have products, because systems are made up from different elements, for example if we have a system for a clinic we will have pacients, doctors, bed rooms, consulting rooms, operation rooms, turns, with this OOP (Object Oriented Programming) we can know which is room is free or occupied. So it is important to think about those useful and important elements for us to create in the system for taking information or to interact. Pacient clinic history o medical history can also be an object with its own identity, with date, number, code, relevant information. In schools we have students, professor, subject, turn, schedule, calendar. All this cases or elementes are candidates to be builder patterns for adding all is entities. Later builder patterns will let pass to something called classes, according to Juan is tha same, because classes are a type or builder pattern. There are another builter patterns or builder functions that we can consider helpers, they're not so obvious, as the above, for example those used to establish relations between things, for example what are the subcriptions of students, number of visits of pacients to the doctor, the appointments, in this last case the appointments can bring information about the pacient, the doctor, the date, hour, room and others.

                        <ul>
                            <li>var productsListItems = document.getElementById('products-list');</li>
                            <li>To assign and replace a text productsListItems.innerHTML = '&lt;li&gt;item 1&lt;/li&gt;</li>
                            <li>To add a new text without replace productsListItems.innerHTML += '&lt;li&gt;item 1&lt;/li&gt;</li>
                        </ul>
                        For not to put always .innerHTML we can use a helper variable and store the new list items:
                        <ul>
                            <li>var productListItems = '';</li>
                            <li>productsListItems += '&lt;li&gt;item 1&lt;/li&gt;</li>
                            <li>var productsList = document.getElementById('products-list')</li>
                            <li>productsList.innerHTML = productsListItems;</li>
                        </ul>
                        Using this method and template strings we can add a new set of list elements, like this:
                        <ul>
                            <li>document.getElementById('products-list').innerHTML = productsListItems;</li>
                            <li>var productsListItems = `&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="product-title"&gt;${product1.brand} ${product1.name}&lt;/span&gt;(${product1.category}): $${product1.price}&lt;/li&gt;`;</li>
                        </ul>
                        In template strings it's used to close the backtick ` (Alt + } + Espace) in a line apart to the closing element tag, and semicolons in the last line. The span is used in the example to show we an add bold style to the text. <b>Tip aside: If we have a bold text and don't want to bring a lot of attention we can set color: #333, it's a dark grey that lowers the intensity of the color.</b>

They're not, but for practical effects they're kind of are. ECMAScript is a scripting language definition. ECMAScript determines the especifications for JavaScript.

                    <li><span class="hour">1:28:00 to 1:55:00:</span> Variable declarations let and const. When we use var we can declare a variable more than one time and console won't show us any error, that can be problematic or dangerous. Instead if we use let or const it will show a syntax error: "Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'lastName' has already been declared", assuring it won't be another variable declaration. Other difference is related with the scope of the variables. Also, with const we won't be able to assign again the variable, but it will be possible to change it, but through other ways, not with a new assignation, as we did with var and as we can do with let (<b>That's the only difference between let and const</b>). Const are not unchangable because constant is not the same as inmutable: Constant ‚â† Inmmutable. The best practice is to use always const and if it doesn't work use let. If we don't need the variable to change its value we use const and let when there is no other alternative.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:55:00 to 2:00:00:</span> Almost in every programming language constants are write with first letter uppercase and they are a different element from the variables. In JavaScript constants are a type of variable. For inmultable values we use const with upercases, for const objects we use lowercases and for numbers or primitive values (not objects) we also use lowercases. For example: const IVA = 19; const ENTERPRISE_NAME = 'Martelli and Associates'.Sometimes even for objects, but inmmutable ones we also use uppercases.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:01:00 to 2:12:00:</span>Relationship between window object and var. When we make a declaration with var, the values will transform in properties of window object. Window has within document, innerHeight and others. That doesn't happen with let or const.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:15:00 to 2:34:00:</span>Scope of variables. Brackets can be use to wrap code and are called anonymous blocks, works like this: {console.log('one thing');}. One thing to take into account is that var is not deprecated in the language because there are a lot of machines and websites that works with var in their coding structures. So if we create an anonymous block with var, let and const, like this: {var aVar= 50; let aLet = 60; const aConst = 70;} if we call aVar outside the block it will work, but alet and aCons will show an Uncaught ReferenceError: aLet("or aConst") is not defined. That's a good thing because we have more control of the variables and it's important that they respect the scope of the block they are, frecuently when we work with variables within a block we don't want them to be available outside the block, if we want that we use global variables. If I create a variable with the same name using let or const outside and inside the block they will be two different variables because of the scope, but with var will be the same variable, for var just doesn't matter the brackets and the block. In the console we can use console.group('Here we can put the title of the group') to organize and tabulate the console.logs, and to close it we use console.groupEnd(). There is also console.groupcollapsed(); it's the same but collapsed.</li>

                    <li><span class="hour">00:00 to 13:00:</span> A little review about scope of variables. var let and const. The behaviour is the same in a conditional block:
                        if (true) {
                            var ifVar       = 'A';
                            let ifLet       = 'B';
                            const ifConst   = 'C';
                            console.log('ifVar:', ifVar);
                            console.log('ifLet:', ifLet);
                            console.log('ifConst:', ifConst);
                        }; Outside the block we only can call ifVar in a console.log(ifVar), ifLet and ifConst will show "Uncaught ReferenceError: ifLet/ifConst is not defined". It happens the same with a while or a for: for (var iVar = 0; iVar < 5; iVar++) { /* ... */ }; 
                        for (let iLet = 0; iLet < 5; iLet++) { /* ... */ }; console.log('Valor de iVar despu√©s del for:', iVar);
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">13:00 to 18:00:</span> The scope functions is the only scope var recognize, so they won't be available outside the function, unless we create a global variable. In this case var behaves similarly as let does.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">19:00 to 42:00:</span> Hoisting. The word hoisting means to raise, to hoist, to run up, to fly. According to MDN: <em>"JavaScript Hoisting refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions, variables or classes to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code."</em> To be clear with this it's important first to know the concepts of declarative and expressive syntax. In declarative syntax we put the reserve word for each term as var, function or class, but in expressive syntax we don't as assigning a value without declare the word var, for example num = 6, or putting a function inside another element. Look at this Platzi definitions: <strong>A declarative function: when we use the reserve word function at the beginning function sayHello(name) {console.log(`Hello ${name}`);}</strong>, meanwhile <strong>a expressive function begins with the reserve word var and the anonymous function is stored in the variable var name = function(name){console.log(`Hello ${name}`);}</strong>. Hoisting only apply in the reserve words var and function, it means for expressive functions does not apply the hoisting. In other wors with declarative variables, classes or functions, we can call them before they are declare and with expressive function we have to call them after the declaration. For more info about it visit: <a href="https://platzi.com/clases/1814-basico-javascript/26295-cuando-utilizar-una-funcion-declarativa-y-una-expr/" target="_blank">https://platzi.com/clases/1814-basico-javascript/26295-cuando-utilizar-una-funcion-declarativa-y-una-expr/</a>. Variables declared with let and const are also hoisted but, unlike var, are not initialized with a default value. An exception will be thrown if a variable declared with let or const is read before it is initialized. Note that it is the order in which code is executed that matters, not the order in which it is written in the source file. The code will succeed provided the line that initializes the variable is executed before any line that reads it. For more info about it, visit: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting" target="_blank">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting</a>. Now, take into account that var is hoisted and is available from the top or the file, but it has an undefined value. In the case of let is also hoisted, it exists, but we can't access to it, for that reason if I call the let variable before the declaration it will throw an Uncaught Reference Error: (name of variable) is not defined. The true is that let is located in de temporal dead zone (TDZ). <em>A let or const variable is said to be in a "temporal dead zone" (TDZ) from the start of the block untiSl code execution reaches the line where the variable is declared and initialized.</em> For more info about it, visit: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let" target="_blank">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let</a>. If we assign a function to a variable it will behave all the same. To access a variable, class or function before the declaration is a bad practice. When creating function or arrow function is common to use const to store them, because we rarely will want to make a new assignment.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">43:00 to 53:00:</span> <strong>Arrow functions.</strong> Arrow functions only work for expressive functions. First, some examples of declarative and expressive functions: // Declarative function
                        // function adding (num1, num2) {
                        //     const total = num1 + num2;
                        //     return total;
                        // }. // expressive anonymous function
                        // const sumar = function (num1, num2) {
                        //     const total = num1 + num2;
                        //     return total;
                        // }; For transforming the expressive function in an arrow function, fist we remove the word "function" and put an arrow => after the arguments (num1, num2).</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">53:00 to 1:17:00:</span> In those cases where we have just one value to return in a function, like this: const divide = (num1, num2) => {return num1 / num2;} it is possible to remove the brackets and the word return, likr this: const divide = (num1, num2) => num1 / num2; In a real system we can have variables with names like average, totalSells, totalJanuary, totalFebruary. Some examples of arrow functions using mathematical operations: const adding = (num1, num2) => num1 + num2; const substract = (num1, num2) => num1 - num2; const multiply = (num1, num2) => num1 / num2; const dividir = (num1, num2) => num1 / num2; const power = (num1, num2) => num1 ** num2; const square = (num) => multiply(num, num); const cube = (num) => multiply(num ** 3); <strong>In these last cases, when the function receives just one parameter, we can remove the parenthesis const square = num => num * num; const cube = num => num ** 3;</strong>. <strong>In minute 56 Juan explains how to use a group of functions to calculate a value.</strong></li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:13:00 to 1:19:00:</span> In JavaScript we have mathematical constants like the value Pi Math.PI. So we can console.log(Math.PI). We can use a function to get the Pi value const getPi = () => Math.PI; for this case we can not remove the parenthesis, because it will throw an Uncaught SyntaxError.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:20:00 to 1:42:00:</span> console.log returns nothing. Examples of function's returnings:
                    <ul>
                        <li>function getNumber () {return 20;}; // returns 20</li>
                        <li>function getString () {return 'text';}; // returns 'text'</li>
                        <li>function getNull () {return null;}; // returns null</li>
                        <li>function getUndefined1 () {return undefined;}; // returns undefined</li>
                        <li>function getUndefined2 () {return;}; // returns undefined. <strong>When functions has no value declared to return, they return undefined</strong></li>
                        <li>function getUndefined3 () {}; // returns undefined. <strong>When functions has no return word within, they return undefined</strong></li>
                        <li>function getUndefined4 () {return console.log('Something');}; // returns undefined</li>
                    </ul>
                    That means the operations and results within a function has no relation with the return value of the function. Alert, console.log doesn't return values, confirm return a boolean and prompt returns a string. For practical effects within an arrow function for a console.log we can remove the parenthesis and the word return and this still return undefined, like this: const getUndefined5 = () => console.log('Yellow') // returns undefined. So to get the result of a function we have to return it, otherwise it will return undefined.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:42:00 to 1:50:00:</span> <em>Math is a built-in object that has properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions.

                    </ul>
                    <strong>To see in the browser if offline we go to Network in DevTools, click in No throttling ("en espa√±ol: no ahorcado") and switch between No throttling and Offline.</strong>. showAlertSuccess and showAlertDanger are two functions.
                    <ul>
                        <li>const showAlertSuccess = message => {showAlert(message, 'success');};</li>

                    </ul>
                    At the same time the arguments message and type ('sucess' and 'danger') allow us to programm with JavaScript the conditions to show the alert :
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            const showAlert = (message, type) => {
                                if (type === 'success') {
                                    toggleClass('danger', 'success');
                                } else {
                                    toggleClass('success', 'danger');
                                }
                                alertMessage.classList.add('alert');
                                alertMessage.innerHTML = message;
                                setTimeout(() => {
                                    alertMessage.innerHTML = '';
                                    alertMessage.classList.remove('alert', 'success', 'danger');
                                }, 5000);
                            };
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    With setTimeout we define to add an empty string '' and remove .classList.remove the classes to the div element after 5000 miliseconds (5 seconds) Minutos 53. In the HTML we have a div without value and with the id 'alert-message' const alertMessage = document.getElementById('alert-message');. To change the style of the alert-message we can program it with a const toggleClass using the method.classList:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            const toggleClass = (oldClass, newClass) => {
                                alertMessage.classList.remove(oldClass);
                                alertMessage.classList.add(newClass);
                            };
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    For giving style to the alert, here an example:
                    <ul>
                        <li>body {font-family: Arial, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, sans-serif;}</li>
                        <li>.alert {border: 2px solid #222;
                            padding: .4em;
                            width: max-content;
                            position: fixed;
                            background-color: #272727;
                            color: #f1f1f1;
                            bottom: 1em;
                            left: 50%;
                            transform: translateX(-50%);
                            border-radius: 4px;
                            box-shadow: 4px 4px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, .2);
                            }
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            .success {
                                color: rgb(34, 212, 49);
                            }
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            .danger {
                                color: hsl(4, 100%, 67%);
                            }
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>For the CSS property transform Juan recommends to look for information related with it, it could be very useful and interesting.</strong>.

                    To Camilo's question about functionality offline emerge an answer from Juan in reference to certain insteresting topics as:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Minute: 50:00: Knowing that is offline helps us to assign some interactions, for example deactivate a buy button or inform that the state of seats or rooms showed up could change after reconnection, or let the user send a form after reconnection. </li>
                        <li>AJAX: the possibility to connect with the server without refreshing the webpage, we can programm that when online ask the server if there were any modification or update.</li>
                        <li>For let the user to store changes or store provisionaly we use two APIS or incorporated functionalities: 1. localStorage and 2. sesionStorage.</li>
                        <li>There are also cookies to save the information for later visits.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">01:07:00 to 1:16:00:</span> <strong>Refactoring, to correct and made a better and efficient code. When refactoring the application and the result must be the same, the user even doesn't need to notice it. If there is any change is not refactoring, it's improving.</strong> Question about testing, the tester profiles, a tester is not necessarily a person with knowlege in development. Comments about quality assurance in software and programming.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:16:00 to 1:22:00</span> In an HTML if I have 20 p elements and put the script tag after the 3th one and before the following 17, and call the p elements in JavaScript using window.document.getElementsByTagName('p'); only the first 3 will be part of the HTMLCollection. To avoid that we can use the event 'DOMContentLoaded'and we can call it with window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {console.log('contenido del DOM cargado')}); with this statement the action we put inside will be executed right after the DOM content is loaded</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:22:00 to 1:56:00:</span> DOM is the same window.document, through document we can access to body: document.body, that way document.body.title = 'Body's title'; document.title = 'Webpage's title';</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:24:00 to 1:30:00:</span> A summary of CSS and selectors and forms to looking for elements with JavaScript:
                    <ul>
                        <li>const productosEl = document.getElementById('productos'); // Return value: Element</li>
                        <li>const todosLosH2 = document.getElementsByTagName('h2'); // Return value: HTMLCollection</li>
                        <li>const todosLosH1 = document.getElementsByTagName('h1'); // Return value: HTMLCollection</li>
                        <li>const todosLosDestacados = document.getElementsByClassName('destacado'); // Return value: HTMLCollection</li>
                    </ul>
                    Note aside: "console.dir". In addition to the above we can use querySelector and querySelectorAll. The first one, that means querySelector, will return the fist selector found. To look for all selector we use querySelectorAll, it will return a NodeList with all the selectors.
                    <ul>
                        <li>const primerH1 = document.querySelector('h1'); // Return value: First selector element</li>
                        <li>const elementosDestacados = document.querySelectorAll('.destacado'); // Return value: NodeList of the selectors found (don't forget the point "." in the class selector)</li>
                        <li>We can look for all the headings: const todosLosHeadings = document.querySelectorAll('h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6');</li>
                        <li>We can use it for descendants and child selectors document.querySelector('p.destacado').innerHTML = 'Soy un p√°rrafo destacado';</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:56:00 to 2:12:00:</span> Difference between NodeList and HTMLCollection: NodeList allows to loop through the elements in a simple way. Because they have defined the method forEach
                    <ul>
                        <li>const pruebaSpan2 = document.querySelectorAll('span');      // NodeList</li>
                        <li>pruebaSpan2.forEach( element => element.innerHTML = '‚≠ê' );</li>
                    </ul>
                    ForEach allows to loop through the element, using a callback to iterate it. The querySelector and querySelectorAll are new forms to look for elements. That's why forEach works just with NodeList, not with HTMLCollections.
                    <em>Note aside: New CSS property for list elements: ul {list-style-position: inside;} to put the points inside the li elements.</em>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:13:00 to 2:35:00:</span> We can create elements using document.createElement. Juan shows us a example:
                    <ul>
                        <li>First he creates an event for the button btn-load-content: document.querySelector('.btn-load-content').addEventListener('click', () => {const containerLElement = document.querySelector('.container');</li>
                        <li>Second he creates a new element: const nuevoP = document.createElement('p');</li>
                        <li>He adds a content to the new element: nuevoP.innerHTML = 'Contenido';</li>
                        <li>A title: nuevoP.title = 'T√≠tulo del contenido';</li>
                        <li>A class: nuevoP.classList.add('contenido');</li>
                        <li>To add the new element as child of other element we use the method .appendChild: containerLElement.appendChild(nuevoP); It adds the new element at the end of the father element</li>
                        <li>Also we can add the element in a determined position with the method .insertAdjacentElement. This method asks in the first argument where we want to inser the element: containerLElement.insertAdjacentElement('beforebegin', nuevoP); // to insert the element it before begin</li>
                        <li>containerLElement.insertAdjacentElement('afterbegin', nuevoP); // to insert the element it after begin</li>
                        <li>containerLElement.insertAdjacentElement('beforeend', nuevoP);   // to insert the element it before begin in an equivalent position to method appendChild()</li>
                        <li>containerLElement.insertAdjacentElement('afterend', nuevoP); // to insert the element it after end</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li>.display-inline {display: inline;} // Change block elements into line elements.</li>
                        <li>.display-inline-block {display: inline-block;} // They behave as block elements, but in the same line. The can have width and height.</li>

                    </ul>
                    We can not define a width or height to line elements (a, links), first I must change their behaviour to block or inline-block with display property. In line elements padding-top and padding-bottom don't take the place of the other elements, than means the don't open the line of a paragraph. It will be seen if it has a color. It happens the same with margin-top and margin-bottom. It works with padding and margin left and right.

                    <li><span class="hour">2:07:00 to 2:29:00:</span> Position relative and position absolute. According to MDN: <em>"The position CSS property sets how an element is positioned in a document. The top, right, bottom, and left properties determine the final location of positioned elements."</em> When we talk of positioned elements we're talking about elements that hasn't the position value static (default value)
                    <ul>
                        <li>position: static; // Default value.</li>
                        <li>position: relative;</li>

                        <li>position: stiky;</li>
                    </ul>
                    The property line-height is used to separete lines of text, in general is 16px. A trick to align a text vertically in a box is, for example the box has a height of 100px, then put the line-height equals to the box height (100px). To align horizontally text-align: center. If elements are not positioned, that means they have position: static by default, it won't work the properties: left, right, top and bottom. An element with position relative keeps is original location if we don't define any of the properties left, righ, top or bottom. Now, <strong>the elements with position: relative, the properties left, right, top and bottom are related to their own sides.</strong> So if we set left: 50px; the element will move 50px from the left side to the right, if we set right: 50px; the element will move from the right side to the left. If we define in the box bottom: 50px; the element will move 50px to top, but it keeps its original espace. Position elements are located in front of the other elements of the web page, if those are not position (or with position: static). Also, we can set negative values. The z-index is related with the deep of element in the webpage. All element has by default a z-index of 0. If we have an element with 1 value that will be in front of all others, if we have two the created last one will be in front. The z-index property only works with positioned elements. If an element with position: relative has left and right at the same time or top and bottom at the same time, left wins to right, and top wins to bottom. Also we can use z-index with value negative, z-index: -1; It's common to use z-index with high values of 1000, or 100000 for having a bigger range to work.

                    <li><span class="hour">2:29:00 to 2:40:00:</span> Position absolute. An element with position: absolute keeps is original position but stop occupying a place and interactiong with the next elements or the container. Elements with position absolute take for reference to coordinates left, rigth, top and bottom the sides of the window or the container element, as long as the containing element is positioned. In general we use a container with position: relative for the elements to respect the container position and not being crazy in the world as elements with no order or position to follow. If we use the container with position: absolute the elements will respect the container but the container won't interact with the other elements in the webpage. In position absolute if we put: right: 0; it will be located at the right of the container, top: 0; at the top, bottom: 0; at the bottom of the container, left: 0; it's the value by default.</li>

                    <ul>

                    Face to the question about if its possible to call a pseudoclass from JavaScript, this is an example: document.querySelector('h2:first-of-type'). Pseudoclasses are useful to add decoration without adding more coding or information into the HTML, it's like adding a background-image, border or change the color. The texts in the pseudoelements are not able to copy. The work for decoration, section dividers.

                        ::before and ::after are used always with two colons ::, they can work with just one colon: for compatibility, but now we use two colons in order to not confuse them with pseudoclasses.
                    </ul>
                    We can also add images in pseudoelements and emojis. Now, we can add pretty cools effect with hover to change the pseudoelement when cursor pass over the element:
                    <ul>
                        <li>h3::after {content: "üëàüèª"; /* color: blue; */ Color doesn't work because it has no text.}</li>

                        <li>p:not(.destacado) {font-size: 1.4em;} // It gives style to all elements that haven't the class .desatado</li>
                        <li>strong:not(li strong) {color: deeppink;} // It gives style to all strong that are not descendant of an li element.</li>
                        <li>a:not([href="#"] class="go-to-top") {color: cyan;}</li>
                    </ul>
                    This selector can be call with querySelector and querySelectorAll. In the last example we have an attribute selector, that is, we can use attributes within elements as a selector in CSS, like this:
                    <ul>
                        <li>[title] {text-decoration: underline;}</li>
                        <li>p[title] {background-color: hsl(302, 59%, 10%);}</li>
                        <li>[title="Hola"] {color: yellow;}</li>
                    </ul>
                    An example for using querySelector to call a pseudoclass not: const parrafosSinTitulo = document.querySelectorAll('div p:not([title])'); console.log('parrafosSinTitulo:', parrafosSinTitulo);
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:37:00:</span>Farewell.</li>

                    <li><span class="hour">00:00 to 34:00:</span> Debugger: To debug is to correct errors or mistakes in the code. It's a way to improve. There are different forms to debug, but browsers has their own tools to debug in DevTools. It's common to have errors while coding. In DevTools/Sources we can access to the index.html. Clicking the column of numbers we can create breakpoints. When reload the code will pause in the Breakpoint. With F8 the code will continue running until the next breakpoint. That happens only when the DevTools are opened. Breakpoint are useful to watch what is the code doing in real time. With F10 we can pass to the next line, and with Ctrl + F8 to deactivate the breakpoint. In the right hand we have an area where we can see detailed information about the breakpoints, above it, there is the Scope. Scope allows us to know where are we, and what we have in the Global Scope, that means the object window (the object window will be always available there) and what we have available in the script, for this example two functions created by Juan. Watching in the Scope we emerge some comments about hoisting, because the variable let a = 10; appears in the Scope with value undefined before the initialization, after it, Scope shows that "a" gets the value asigned. We can change the value of a variable in DevTool/Source/Scope and the value will remain with that value. It's like to enter to the core of the code and change a value deep inside the code. The debugger is enjoyable and amusing. We also have Watch: where we can asset expressions, understud as something we can assign to a variable, like: 2: 2; 2 < 3: true; functions as getCompleteName(): "Andr√©z Guti√©rrez"; sayHello(). The following are not expressions: if, while, for.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">34:00 to 44:00:</span> When passing to the next step we can press F11, if there is something to enter (like a function) it enters. In DevTool/Source we also have the Call Stack (<i>"Pila de llamadas"</i>). When we set a Breakpoint, Callstack shows if the point where we are in the code is anonymous (code out or a box or cage, like a free code) or belongs to a escructure with a name. Callstack represents the movements of the code and the process of reading. So it shows where the reading is awating mean something else is read in other part of the code, for example a function or a callback. Therefore each process is stacked one on top of another and the last one must be finished to also finish the one below. When we are within a function Scope shows script, global and local, the last one indicates the elements available just inside that function.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">44:00 to 1:26:00:</span> We can force the debugger to be executed adding the expression debugger in any part of the code, and when DevTools are open the code will stop in this specific line. We would like to do that if we want some part or an specific part of the code to be highlighted: if (b === 0) {debugger}. Some comments about Math.random(), creates random number from 0 to 1. If we multiply it by 10, we're going to have number from 0 to 10: Math.random() * 10. And if we want to round the number we can write: Math.round(Math.random() * 10). For create random numbers, according to Juan they use the hour. In debugger we can also see events, all things related with mouse, keyboard, if we select in mouse click it will show us all the addEventListener we have created. DevTools is a big world. There are another tools to debug. In VS Code we have a Run and Debug button, Ctrl + Shift + D. An example of debugging with an error in the code. In JavaScript null is consider as an object, but in reality it's a primitive value, that's a known bug of the language. Some questions about window element and its values or properties. Be aware in which line and file the console specifies the error, it could be in the HTML, CSS or js file.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:27:00 to 1:54:00:</span> Advanced events. First a summary of how to add events directly in the HTML: &lt;button class="btn-click" onclick="console.log('Hola');"&gt;Haceme click!&lt;/button&gt;, To see more: <a href="/clase20/01-eventos/index.html" target="_blank">Class 20 - Events.</a> That's not a proper way to do that. Now, if we want to assign a primitive value (number, boolean or string) from JavaScript to the property onClick, using querySelector we won't be able to do it, like this:
                    <ol>
                        <li>const btnClick = document.querySelector('.btn-click'); // create the constant btnClick and asign the value of the selector .btn-click, that means the button.</li>
                        <li>btnClick.onClick = `console.log('Hola')`; // It won't work. It's like onClick refuse to recieve data from scripts, data should be add directly within the HTML tag.</li>
                    </ol>
                    A summary of the use of backtips and backslash \ for strings. Returning to onClick we do can add a callback, like this:
                    <ul>
                        <li>btnClick.onclick = function () { console.log('Hiciste click!'); }; console.log(btnClick.onclick); // console.log will show that the onClick attribute has the function.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Also we can reassign a new callback to the event. <strong>But watch out with the following error when assigning a callback to an event: btn.onClick = one(); in this case the parenthesis execute the function, so in reality we are not assigning the function but the value returned by it. To avoid this we need to remove the parenthesis.</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:55:00 to 2:04:00:</span> Multiple callback assignation to the event click. Well we can use the addEventListener method for the event 'click':
                    <ul>
                        <li>btnClick.addEventListener('click', uno);</li>
                        <li>btnClick.addEventListener('click', dos);</li>
                        <li>btnClick.addEventListener('click', () => { console.log('Tres!'); });</li>
                        <li>btnClick.addEventListener('click', () => console.log('Cuatro!'));</li>
                        <li>btnClick.addEventListener('click', function () { console.log('Cinco!'); });</li>
                    </ul>
                    In DevTools, Elements, we can select the button (btnClick element) and in the tab Event Listeners we will see all the Event Listerners available, even we can remove some of them, or all of them. Also, in Sources in the folder main.js/Event Listener Breakpointss/Mouse/Click to check and when reload the page, they will react or paused in any event available.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:05:00 to 2:11:00:</span> Object event. When we regiter an event with addEventListener: btnClick.addEventListener('click', () => {}); inside the partenthesis we can add a variable or object. That variable will be called as we want, usually we use the name event or e. That element will give us information about the event, e.g. in what coordinates was clicked on:
                    <ul>
                        <li>btnClick.addEventListener('click', (e) => {console.log('e.pageX x e.pageY:', e.pageX + 'x' + e.pageY);});</li>
                        
                        <li>console.log(e); // within the addEventListener scope to see the information of the object e in the console.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:11:00 to 2:15:00:</span> The callback can be defined outside. Like this:
                        <ul>
                            <li>const mostrarCoordenadasMouse = e => {console.log('e.pageX x e.pageY:', e.pageX + 'x' + e.pageY);};</li>
                            <li>btnClick.addEventListener('click', mostrarCoordenadasMouse); // <strong>Watch out! If the function had parentheses it would be executed and the callback would not be passed.</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        If we add more than one variable event inside the parenthesis of an addEventListener function, the next variable won't be take into account.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:16:00 to 2:32:00:</span> Bubbling. We have 3 boxes (div elements) in HTML. We call them with querySelector:
                    <ul>
                        <li>const uno = document.querySelector('.box--1');</li>
                        <li>const dos = document.querySelector('.box--2');</li>
                        <li>const tres = document.querySelector('.box--3');</li>
                    </ul>
                    Box one contains box two and three and box two contains box three. Now we add a Listener to the event click with addEventListener:
                    <ul>
                        <li>tres.addEventListener('click', e => {console.log('*** CLICK EN TRES ***');});</li>
                        <li>dos.addEventListener('click', e => {console.log('** CLICK EN DOS **');});</li>
                        <li>uno.addEventListener('click', e => {console.log('* CLICK EN UNO *');});</li>
                    </ul>
                    By default the behaviour of the event propagation when click is bubbling, that means when we click the box three also we will be interacting with box 2 and box 1, moving from the most specific to the most general

                        As we see before bubbling is the default behaviour of events, going from the deepest element to the outermost.
                        <ul>
                            <li>tres.addEventListener('click', e => {console.log('*** CLICK EN TRES ***');});</li>
                            <li>dos.addEventListener('click', e => {console.log('** CLICK EN DOS **');});</li>
                            <li>uno.addEventListener('click', e => {console.log('* CLICK EN UNO *');});</li>
                        </ul>
                        With bubbling the reaction occurs from the element clicked to the element container. Now, it's important to know that addEventListener has three spaces within the parenthesis: addEventListener('click', callback, boolean). The boolean is related with the propagation of the event, hence by default is false, that means bubbling, when true, means capturing. When capturing is setted the event progagation will go from outermost to the deepest , contrary to what bubbling does.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">07:00 to 11:00:</span> To stop the propagation of the method we can set the method stopPropagation() to the event: e.stopPropagation(). Ot works for boolean values in false or in true.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">11:00 to 26:00:</span> Event delegation to document. An attribute of the object event is .target, we can use it for determine what element within the document was clicked:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            document.addEventListener('click', e => {console.log(e); const elementoClickeado = e.target; console.dir(elementoClickeado);console.dir(elementoClickeado.id);
                            console.log(e.target);
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    Now, we can program the addEventLister to react when we click in an specific element within the document using conditional, like this:
                    <ul>
                        <li>if (e.target.id === 'item-2') {console.warn('Click en item 2');return;}</li>
                        <li>if (e.target.id === 'item-5') {console.warn('Click en item 5');return;}</li>
                        <li>if (e.target.id === 'parrafo-a'){console.warn('Click en p√°rrafo A');return;</li>
                        <li>if (e.target.id === 'parrafo-d')console.warn('Click en p√°rrafo D'); return;}</li>
                    </ul>
                    We use the return to stop the function after the assestment of each conditional if, to avoid making if...else. The event can react to other events as mouseover, mouseout, and others.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">27:00 to 30:00:</span> The following is a not recommended way to do this event delegation: using forEach, like this:
                    <ul>
                        <li>document.querySelectorAll('li').forEach(unLi => {unLi.addEventListener('click', e => {console.log('Click en un &lt;li&gt;'); e.target.innerHTML += ' - Clickeado!';});}); // That change the .innerHTML of each element clicked in the list</li>
                    </ul>
                    It's not recommended to use it, because behind the forEach there is a secuence of long processes happening, it's something like this:
                    <ul>
                        <li>const lis = document.querySelectorAll('li')</li>
                        <li>lis[0].addEventListener('click', e => { e.target.innerHTML += ' - Clickeado!'; });</li>
                        <li>lis[1].addEventListener('click', e => { e.target.innerHTML += ' - Clickeado!'; });</li>
                        <li>lis[2].addEventListener('click', e => { e.target.innerHTML += ' - Clickeado!'; });</li>
                        <li>lis[3].addEventListener('click', e => { e.target.innerHTML += ' - Clickeado!'; });</li>
                        <li>lis[4].addEventListener('click', e => { e.target.innerHTML += ' - Clickeado!'; });</li>
                        <li>lis[5].addEventListener('click', e => { e.target.innerHTML += ' - Clickeado!'; });</li>
                        <li>lis[6].addEventListener('click', e => { e.target.innerHTML += ' - Clickeado!'; });</li>
                    </ul>
                    That means seven functions need to be created in order to run this code. In a greater web site, with a lot of code this could be a problem in the performance of the web site.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">30:00 to 46:00:</span> All the same we cannot use 500 if to program the event delegation in a web site. For that reason we use segmented event delegation. Note: e.target.tagName shows in uppercases the name of the tag clicked. And example of segmented event delegtion is the following function:
                        <ul>
                            <li>const cardsContainer = document.querySelector('.cards-container'); // We assign the element with the selector '.cards-container' to the const cardsContainer</li>
                            <li>cardsContainer.addEventListener('click', e => {}); // We set an addEventListener to execute a function to this element  when the event click occurs.</li>
                            <li>if (e.target.tagName === 'BUTTON') {} // Within the addEventListener we set a conditional if using the method .tagName, that way if the tagName of the e.target clicked is stricly the same as "BUTTON" we want that it makes the following:</li>
                            <li>e.target.innerHTML = 'Comprado!'; // To change the .innerHTML of the button by comprado!.</li>
                            <li>const article = e.target.closest('article.card'); // To declare a const called article and with the method .closest, assign it the closest element article with the class .card.</li>
                            <li>e.target.disabled = true; // Set the attribute disabled in true to inactivate the button.</li>
                            <li>article.classList.add('comprado'); // To add the class 'comprado' to the element to show it with a particular style.</li>
                            <li>article.querySelector('h3').innerHTML += ' (comprado)'; // We look for the element 'h3' inside the article using querySelector and modify its .innetHTML to add the string ' (comprado)'.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">47:00 to 54:00:</span> To create a new element we can use the method .createElement. We have different altenatives: This is the first one:
                        <ul>
                            <li>document.addEventListener('click', function (e) {} // We create an addEventListener for execute a function when click.</li>
                            <li>if (e.target.id === 'estatico') {console.warn('Click en bot√≥n est√°tico!'); // Set a conditional if to do something when the if of e.target was strictly equals to 'estatico', that's the id of a button hardcoded in the HTML.</li>
                            <li>const _dinamico = document.createElement('button'); // We can use the method .createElement to create a new element, in this case a button.</li>
                            <li>_dinamico.innerHTML = 'Din√°mico'; // We can set an .innetHTML.</li>
                            <li>_dinamico.id = 'dinamico'; // And we can also set an id.</li>
                        </ul>
                        That way we create a new button called 'dinamico' when click the button 'estatico'. Now the problem is that everytime we click the button it will create a new 'dinamico' button. To avoid this we assign a false value to new variable let buttonAlreadyCreated = false. And in the conditional if we ask fot the negation of the variable, like this: if (!buttonAlreadyCreated), that means if not created the button execute the code and create one. Finally we have to set the value of buttonAlreadyCreated with true at the final part of the function. That way we avoid the function to execute again the code because the value !true is false, and that way it won't get into the conditional.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">54:00 to 58:00:</span> Second alternative: It's the same as before, but within the if we put as condition the existence of the button, that means if (buttonAlreadyCreated) and finished the function with a return, but we have to keep the value of false for the let buttonAlreadyCreated and changing it to true at the end. That return is called an early return. Because it's not good to have a big part of code inside a conditional, it's not good, it's not pretty.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">58:00 to 1:00:00:</span> Third alternative: To disable the button 'estatico' when the event happens, adding within the addEventListener th method _estatico.disabled = true; that way the button won't be available after the click.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:00:00 to 1:07:00:</span> Fourth alternative: Using e.target.id and create a conditional if(e.target.id === 'estatico') and disable it after the creation of the new element, using e.target.diabled = true.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:08:00 to 1:12:00</span> The better way to do this is inside each conditional if to call a function, for example:
                    <ul>
                        <li>if (e.target.id === 'estatico') {eventoEstatico(); return;}</li>
                        <li>if (e.target.id === 'encabezado') {eventoEncabezado(); return;}</li>
                        <li>if (e.target.id === 'dinamico') {eventoDinamico(); return;}</li>
                    </ul>
                    The idea is to automatize everything. There are another structures like object, that we can program to indicate an action when they're click. That's a more complex process.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:13:00 to 1:17:00:</span> Events with automatic behaviour. If we use the method e.preventDefault() within an addEventListener for an anchor element we can avoid the link to work, so when click it won't open the link. We can use this for example with a confirm, to prevent the link to open if the user press cancel. This is the coding for the two examples above:
                    <ul>
                        <li>document.getElementById('vinculo2').addEventListener('click', e => {e.preventDefault();});</li>
                        <li>document.getElementById('vinculo3').addEventListener('click', e => {if (!confirm('Est√°s seguro de querer ir a google?')) {e.preventDefault();}}); // Notice we show ask if !confirm, that is if not confirm, then we enter the function.</li>
                    </ul>
                    With e.preventDefault() we can also cancel the behaviour by default of a form to not send us to any place.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:17:00 to 1:20:00:</span> Example of advanced event for window using the event resize:
                    <ul>
                        <li>window.addEventListener('resize', () => {console.log('Cantidad de veces:', ++cantidadDeVeces); console.log('Se cambi√≥ el tama√±o del navegador'); medidasInner.innerHTML = `${innerWidth} x ${innerHeight}`; medidasOuter.innerHTML = `${outerWidth} x ${outerHeight}`;});</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:20:00 to 1:27:00:</span> A setTimeout, setInterval and clearInterval summary. First we have two tag buttons:
                    <ul>
                        <li>id="btn-iniciar-intervalo">Iniciar intervalo 1</li>
                        <li>id="btn-detener-intervalo">Detener intervalo 1</li>
                    </ul>
                    And then we can define the actions to start in an specific time (setTimeout) or that happens over a period of time (setInterval) or to stop the interval (clearInterval):
                    <ul>
                        <li>setTimeout(() => {console.error('Pasaron 6 segundos desde que se carg√≥ la p√°gina');
                        }, 6000); // The console.log will occur 6 seconds after the page realoding.</li>
                        <li>document.getElementById('btn-iniciar-intervalo').addEventListener('click', () => {let intervalo1 = setInterval(() => {console.warn('...tick ‚è±Ô∏è...');}, 1000);}); // Program the button 'Iniciar intervalo 1'</li>
                        <li>document.getElementById('btn-detener-intervalo').addEventListener('click', () => {clearInterval(intervalo1);}); // Stops the interval</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:28:00 to 1:59:00:</span> Custom events: We can create any event we want and define when we want it start or happens. First this is the code to created
                    <ul>
                        <li>const evProductoComprado = new Event('productocomprado'); // 'productocomprado' in lowercase, necessarily, is the name of the event.</li>
                        <li>const evTextosModificados = new Event('textosmodificados');</li>
                    </ul>
                    Then we program what will happen when the event occurs and when it will happen:
                    <ul>
                        <li>document.addEventListener('productocomprado', () => {console.warn('Se compr√≥ un producto!!!');}) // Program what will happen.</li>
                        <li>document.dispatchEvent(evProductoComprado); // Makes the event to dispatch, to happen.</li>
                    </ul>
                    We can program a button to dispatch the event when clicked or doble clicked.
                    <ul>
                        <li>document.getElementById('btn1').addEventListener('click', () => {document.dispatchEvent(evProductoComprado);});</li>
                    </ul>
                    We also can program an area or element to react and to dispatch the event when mouse enter:
                    <ul>
                        <li>document.getElementsByClassName('comprar')[0].addEventListener('mouseenter', () => {document.dispatchEvent(evProductoComprado);});</li>
                    </ul>
                    Or we can just make the event happens in an interval of time:
                    <ul>
                        <li>setInterval(() => {console.log('Pasaron 4 segundos.....'); document.dispatchEvent(evProductoComprado);}, 4000);</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:00:00 to 2:31:00:</span> Programming inputs with the customized event:
                    <ul>

                        <li>const inputsTexto = document.querySelectorAll('#input1, #input2, #input3');</li>
                        <li>inputsTexto[0].addEventListener('input', () => {document.dispatchEvent(evTextosModificados);});</li>
                        <li>inputsTexto[1].addEventListener('input', () => {document.dispatchEvent(evTextosModificados);});</li>
                        <li>inputsTexto[2].addEventListener('input', () => {document.dispatchEvent(evTextosModificados);});</li>
                    </ul>
                    To delete a method in an object we use the operator delete, for example: delete e.info, that will delete the property info.

                <ul>
                    <li><span class="hour">00:00 to 20:00:</span> Some questions about querySelector and the use of video and music. It is better to let audio mute in web pages. About font, it is better to download the formats WTFO2 or WOFF2, TTF u OTF are more used for print formats.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">21:00 to 33:00:</span> Within input elements in HTML we can set the attribute required to force the user to fill content in the input, but that can be removed from the DevTools/Elements. So we need to use JavaScript to add other validations. We can use the method HTMLSelectElement.checkValidity(), according to MDN: <em>"The HTMLSelectElement.checkValidity() method checks whether the element has any constraints and whether it satisfies them. If the element fails its constraints, the browser fires a cancelable invalid event at the element, and then returns false."</em></li>
                    <li><span class="hour">33:00 to 52:00:</span> In this example we have 3 elements called in JavaScript, a form, a btn-submit and an input:
                    <ul>
                        <li>const form = document.getElementById('form');</li>
                        <li>const btnSubmit = document.querySelector('.btn-submit');</li>
                        <li>const inputName = document.getElementById(name);</li>
                    </ul>
                    So, first we add the method e.preventDefault() to the btnSumbit:
                    <ul>
                        <li>btnSubmit.addEventListener('click', e => {e.preventDefault}; // This disable the validation messages from the HTML, type of messages as: "Complete this field".</li>
                    </ul>
                    We can ask if the input has validation errors and if the state of the input accomplished the HTML validations, with .checkValidity.
                    <ul>
                        <li>btnSubmit.addEventListener('click', e => {e.preventDefault}; const nameIsValid = inputName.checkValidity() // .checkValidity returns true or false.</li>
                        <li>if (nameIsValid) {let nameValue = inputName.value; console.log('Evento click. Campo validado. Value: ' + nameValue);} else {console.error('El nombre es obligatorio y debe contener 3 caracteres como m√≠nimo.');} // This is to show the value in the console with an if conditional with the variable nameIsValid as argument (That means if there is a nameIsValid variable) and the use of inputName.value to assign the text the user is typing in the input to the variable nameValue, and then show this nameValue in the console with a console.log.</li>
                        <li>else {console.error('El nombre es obligatorio y debe contener 3 caracteres como m√≠nimo.');} // To give a notification in the console that the input is required and have to be 3 characters lenght, as we set in the HTML tag.</li>
                    </ul>
                    This JavaScript configuration can be beated if we deactivate JavaScript in the browser. So the server or page where we send the information must verify the correct fullfilment of the input. So validations are important in the Front End, but they're even more important from the side of the server. We use validations in the Front End for a better user experience and give a little more security, but definitly the server has the responsability to strength the validations to avoid issues. Some comment about the Catch Up, is a type of validation but try to evidence if the user is a human or a bot.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">52:00 to 1:24:00:</span> A better way to do it's to program the form to react when the user tries to send it instead to program the button as above.
                        <ul>
                            <li>form.addEventListener('submit', e => {e.preventDefault();} // In this case the validation messages from the HTML, from the type "Complete this field" will work all the same.</li>
                        </ul>
                        Even if we don't have the HTML validation we can create a function to validate the form and set the validation value criteria in variables:
                        <ul>
                            <li>const validateName = value => {return value} // This function will be executed inside the form.addEventListener.</li>
                            <li>const valueLength = value.length; const minLength = 3; const maxLength = 20; let message = '';// This variables and values are the criteria to asses or validate. They are created within the function validateName. <b>The variable message will be used to assign the values we want to show to the user in the console</b></li>
                        </ul>
                        The value returned should be the input value. Within the function we also have to put several conditionals 'if' for each validation error and set to return null, when it returns null:
                        <ul>
                            <li>if (valueLength === 0) {message = 'El nombre es obligatorio.';}</li>
                            <li>else if (valueLength < minLength) {message = `El nombre debe contener ${minLength} caracteres como m√≠nimo`;}</li>
                            <li>else if (valueLength > maxLength) {message = `El nombre debe contener ${maxLength} caracteres como m√°ximo`;}</li>
                            <li>if (message) {console.error(message);return null;} // It doesn't validate</li>
                        </ul>
                        It's recommended to use variables with proper names and put the numbers as minLenght and maxLenght and not just let the free numbers in the code, those are called magic numbers, that is numbers we don't know why are they there.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:24:00 to 1:36:00:</span> Also, we can program the validation using the event input:
                    <ul>
                        <li>inputName.addEventListener('input', e => {console.log(validateName(inputName.value));} // For any modification in the input it will react showing in the console the value of the input. This is something happening in real time.</li>
                    </ul>
                    To show the validation not just in the console, but to user we can add the method reportValidity(); within the addEventListener. We can set customized texts to be show to user in reportValidity() by using the method setCustomValidity, e.g: inputName.setCustomValidity('there is an error') or inputName.setCustomValidity(message). For this we should use a conditional if (message) {inputName.setCustomValidity(message); return null;}. The thing here is that the error message will be showed even after the validation and even when we have a valid input value. So, to hid the message we must add another line with empty strings ('') for inputName.setCustomValidity(''), or with the variable message inputName.setCustomValidity(message), understanding that if the code reached this line is because the message has an empty string inside it, in this case it will accomplished the goal of hid the validation message. Hence we can position in this order to simplify the function:
                    <ul>
                        <li>inputName.setCustomValidity(message);</li>
                        <li>if (message) {return null};</li>
                        <li>return value // This is part of a bigger function block. Check <a href="/clase36/04-validacion-de-formularios-4/index.html" target="_blank">Class 36 - Forms validation 4</a></li>
                    </ul>
                    Now to report validity in real time we add the method within the addEventListener set for the inputName:
                    <ul>
                        <li>inputName.addEventListener('input', e => {form.reportValidity();)}</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:36:00 to 1:55:00:</span> Adding style to the validity messages with CSS. First putting the input in a fiv with class input-group and adding below the input an empty div with the class error-detail to add later the validity message. Then puts the label in display: block, and sets the box-sizing: border-box, width: 100% for the input and for the error detail a font-size: 0.8em; padding 0.3em; background-color hsl(0, 65%, 82%). Brief summary for hsl: First value: RGB (0 RED, 60 Yellow, 120 GREEN, 180 Cyan, 240 BLUE, 300 Magenta), second value saturation (Grey 0 to 100% Full color), third value: lightness/brightness (Black 0 to 100% White), forth value: alfa/transparency (Transparent 0 to 100% opaque). For more information <a href="http://thenewcode.com/61/An-Easy-Guide-To-HSL-Color" target="_blank">An Easy Guide To HSL Color.</a> Now lets continue, some border-radius: 0 0 .3em .3em, red color to the label, background-color: red to the input. A background-image error sign from <a href="https://www.iconfinder.com/" target="_blank">iconfinder</a> in SVG format, saved in a img folder and defined with the properties background-repeat: no repeat; background-size: 14px; background-position: right 3px center and padding-left to the input of 20px to avoid the sign to touch the border of the input; All these properties setted in a class named error. Now by default we set the class error-detail with display: none and .input-group.error .error-detail {display: block}</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:56:00 to 2:09:00</span> With the style defined for the error in a CSS class we can now create a method customized (<b>not standard, that means added and created by us</b>) named setCustomMessage and setted in the inputName variable in JavaScript:
                    <ul>
                        <li>inputName.setCustomMessage(message)</li>
                    </ul>
                    Now, we can add a function to this method the function to add the class error:
                    <ul>
                        <li>inputName.setCustomMessage = (message) => {const inputGroup = inputName.closest('.input-group')} // the method .closest looks for the closest CSS selector.</li>
                        <li>inputGroup.querySelector('.error-detail').innerHTML = message; // inside the selector within the inputGroup element we add the message programed before in the .innerHTML.</li>
                        <li>if (message) {inputGroup.classList.add('error');} else {inputGroup.classList.remove('error');// Finally we add and/or remove the class error through a conditional if, using classList.add and classList.remove, asking if message has information</li>
                        <li>if (message) {inputGroup.classList.toggle('error', true);} else {inputGroup.classList.toggle('error', false);} // or .toggle with value true or false.</li>
                        <li>inputGroup.classList.toggle('error', message); // Or in a shorter way .toggle('error', message). That way we don't need the conditional if.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Making more general the function setCustomMessage, instead of just program the inputName.setCustomMessage as a method for inputName, we can create an independent function const setCustomMessage = (message, element) => {Take the closest element and add or remove the class error} // When adding the parameter 'element' we add the posibility to set the function to different elements, not just one input, but to any other.</li>
                        <li>Then we set const inputGroup = element.closest ('.input-group'); //for element, not just for inputName</li>
                        <li>To avoid spaces to be taken as valid in the input, inside the function const validateName we should add at first the method.trim(): value = value.trim() // that's called in spanish <i>"trimear el valor"</i> and deletes the spaces at the beginning and at the end of the string.</li>
                        <li>It's recommended to better create another variable let clearValue = value.trim(); for not assign a new value to the variable. Then we must use it for the const valueLength = cleanValue.lenght and for the function's return cleanValue.</li>
                        <li>And finally to avoid the user to send HTML characters we can use the method from window object encodeURIComponent: setting at the bottom of the function encodeURIComponent(cleanValue) // We should not put it in the top of the function because it can affect the validation of the conditionals. With this method space is tranformed in %20 or +, characters as &lt; is transformed in %3C and &gt; is transformed in %3E</li>
                        <li>Also, and more recommended we can set that the functions even returns the encodeURIComponent(cleanValue): return encodeURIComponent(cleanValue);</li>
                    </ol>

                <ul>
                    <li><span class="hour">00:00 to 27:00</span> Some questions, explanation about the use of regular expressions, emails, credit cards, adresses, phone number, zip numbers. According to MDN: <em>"Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. In JavaScript, regular expressions are also objects. These patterns are used with the exec() and test() methods of RegExp, and with the match(), matchAll(), replace(), replaceAll(), search(), and split() methods of String. Using a regular expression literal, which consists of a pattern enclosed between slashes, as follows: const re = /ab + c/;".</em> We can create regular expressions in JavaScript in different forms:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Object type declarative form: // with new RegExp(), it has a method .test to evaluate the string.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>const finalTexto = 'la';</li>
                                    <li>const texto = 'h' + 'o' + finalTexto;</li>
                                    <li>const pruebaRegExp = new RegExp(texto);</li>
                                    <li>const pruebaRegExp = new RegExp('abc');</li>
                                    <li>const pruebaRegExp = new RegExp('abc', 'i');</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Literal declarative form: const pruebaRegExp = /abc/i; // This is prefered, even sonarlint recommends to use it instead of new RegExp. But new RegExp is useful when using a prompt or a variable. The letter i is a flag that means insensitive to uppercases and lowercases. Flags goes always at the end of the expression, and there are others.</li>
                        </ul>
                    Now we can test if the strings below match with the regular expression set:
                        <ul>
                            <li>console.log(pruebaRegExp);</li>
                            <li>console.log(pruebaRegExp.test(''));                 // false</li>
                            <li>console.log(pruebaRegExp.test(' '));                // false</li>
                            <li>console.log(pruebaRegExp.test('hola, qu√© tal?'));   // false</li>
                            <li>console.log(pruebaRegExp.test('a b c'));            // false</li>
                            <li>console.log(pruebaRegExp.test('abc'));              // true</li>
                            <li>console.log(pruebaRegExp.test('ABc'));              // true</li>
                            <li>console.log(pruebaRegExp.test('abC'));              // true</li>
                            <li>console.log(pruebaRegExp.test('-abc?'));            // true</li>
                            <li>console.log(pruebaRegExp.test('aBCdef'));           // true</li>
                            <li>console.log(pruebaRegExp.test('ZZZ....ABC####zz')); // true</li>
                        </ul>
                    There are other methods besides test for regular expressions.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">27:00 to 30:00:</span>Som conditionals to test the regular expressions:
                        <ul>

                    <li><span class="hour">30:00 to 40:00:</span> Also, we can use a ternay:

                            <li>console.log(contieneXYZ); // returns S√ç</li>
                        </ul>
                    That way we can evaluate some other strings:
                        <ul>
                            <li>console.log(/xyz/i.test('xyz')?'S√ç':'NO'); // true</li>

                        </ul>
                        Or, using variables to automatize it better, using a new RegExp to use quotes.
                        <ul>
                            <li>else {const nameRegExp = new RegExp(`^[A-Z√Å√â√ç√ì√ö√ë][a-z√°√©√≠√≥√∫√±√º]{${minLength - 1},${maxLength - 1}}$`); if (!nameRegExp.test(value)) {

                        </ul>
                        Generally regular expressions are setted by different platforms as <a href="https://regex101.com/" target="_blank">regex101.com</a>, there is no need to know them in deep. We can always google about them. Other comments and recommendations about the need of selft learning, and to acquired new knowledge by ourself.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">33:00 to 59:00:</span>contenteditable. It's a property of HTML that allows two values: false and true. With the value of true users can modify the element, add text and press enter creating spaces. Now, we can add the property focus to play a little bit. If we put focus in a h1 element, nothing happens, but if we put it in an element with contenteditable true it's going to work, as it works with link elements (a tag). We can add style in CSS  to the focus property using the pseudoclass :focus. p:focus, for all element p with property focus and just :focus for all elements with that property. An interesting property is outline: similar to a border, but is not the same, and when active doesn't change the size of the element. Outline is the frame that appears when an element is in focus. To add style to element with attributes we can use the attribute selector. For example for all elements with the attribute [title] {font-family: Arial, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, sans-serif;}; and also for all elements with the attibute title and the value Hello 2 [title="Hello 2"] {font-family: Arial, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, sans-serif;}. We can do the same for the attribute content edittable:
                    <ul>
                        <li>[contenteditable]{}</li>
                        <li>[contenteditable="true"]{}</li>
                        <li>h3[contenteditable="true"]{} // without space.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Also it's possible to add the property contenteditable to a div, with list elements, and the user will be able to change and modify the data within the div as he were in word, even he would be able to delete all the information, and in this case the div element will remained just with a br tag, put automatically for not to hide the div element for the user interface.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:00:00 to 1:30:00:</span> Adding some programming to contenteditable: First creating an HTML lay out of a sort of form with elements h, p and two buttons. Then some sty with CSS, specially to the button elements, having into account that they have interactive styles from default, but, when we apply styles to them, they lose those styles, so it's important to apply again other interactive styles, like hover, clicked, and that kind of pseudoclasses. Juan recommends every element available for react or interact with user should have any kind of style when interacting, or the cursor change to a hand to show that we can click. It's a very important matter of functionality and accesibility. We don't need to exaggarate the styles for hover, a typical use is to add when hover a lighter background-color and a darker border-color, with an outline-style none, like: .btn:hover {background-color: hsl(195, 57%, 90%0;); border-color: hsl(195, 57%, 35%); outline-style: none;}. Then we call the elements with JavaScript:
                    <ul>
                        <li>const values = document.querySelectorAll('.value'); // It has all the values that we want user can modify</li>
                        <li>const btnEdit = document.getElementById('btn-edit'); // It has the button edit</li>
                        <li>const btnSave = document.getElementById('btn-save'); // It has the button save</li>
                    </ul>
                    Then to enable the edition of the elements using the btn-edit we set the following function:
                    <ul>
                        <li>btnEdit.addEventListener('click', () => {</li>
                        <li>btnEdit.disabled = true; // To turn on the property disable, making the button edit disabled after modifying.</li>
                        <li>btnSave.disabled = false; // To turn off the property disable, making the button save available to be pressed.</li>
                        <li>values.forEach(element => element.contentEditable = true ); // It parses all the element values for enabling the contenteditable property with the value true, so users can modify the elements value.</li>
                        <li>values[0].focus(); // Put the cursor in the first value for a better functionality.</li>

                    </ul>
                    If we disable the btnSave we have to be aware that we also have to disable the hover for that button, we can use the pseudoclass selectors :disabled and enabled. For that reason and to fix that we can set the CSS as .btn:enabled:hover {cursor: pointer; background-color: hsl(195, 57%, 90%0;); border-color: hsl(195, 57%, 35%); outline-style: none;}. In the same context we can program the btnSave to be disabled when click and to enable the btnEdit:
                    <ul>
                        <li>btnSave.addEventListener('click', () => {</li>
                        <li>btnSave.disabled = true; // To turn on the property disable, making the button edit disabled after modifying.</li>
                        <li>btnEdit.disabled = false; // To turn off the property disable, making the button edit available to be pressed.</li>
                        <li>values.forEach(element => element.contentEditable = false ); // It parses all the element values for disabling the contenteditable property with the value false, so user can not modify the elements value.});</li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>Turning on one button and turning of another with .disabled = true; and .disabled = false; is frequently used in coding.</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:30:00 to 1:33:00:</span> Also we can code the event input for the container, using: document.querySelector('.customer-container').addEventListener('input', e => {console.log(e.target.innerHTML);}); that way we can show in the console the changes in the container.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:34:00 to 1:52:00:</span> localStorage. It's the first type of data persistence. According to MDN <em>"The localStorage read-only property of the window interface allows you to access a Storage object for the Document's origin; the stored data is saved across browser sessions."</em> Another type of persistence are cookies and sessionStorage. It belongs to HTML5. If we write console.log(localStorage); we will see in the console the object storage. It's a window property. In very old browser localStorage was not available. Well, localStorage has a serial of methods:
                    <ul>
                        <li>localStorage.getItem (key: string) // To call the key stored.</li>
                        <li>localStorage.setItem (key: string, value: string) // To set in the localStorage an item.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Hence, in the class example, if we put first localStorage.setItem('name', 'value') in the console localStorage.getItem('name'), we're going to receive in return "value". We can find localStorage in DevTools (F12)/Application. It just store strings. In DevTools/Application we can directly delete the stored elements. Any user have his own localStorage.
                    </li>

                    <li><span class="hour">00:00 to 10:00:</span>Attributes-data are attributes customized, they area like containers for additional metadata content within the tags. Examples:
                    <ul>
                        <li><p id="parrafo1" data-ciudad="La Plata" data-provincia="Buenos Aires" data-codigo-de-sucursal="3">Sucursal con info oculta.</p></li>

                    </ul>
                    We can access to the attributes using the method .dataset.
                    <ul>
                        <li>const _parrafo1 = document.getElementById('parrafo1');</li>
                        <li>console.log(_parrafo1.dataset);</li>

                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">10:00 to 42:00</span> Some uses of attributes-data and .dataset. Some style for CSS cards in a student list example, use of adyacent siblings using +, or all siblings using ~: h2 ~ p {}; h2 + p {}; summary position absolute and position relative. Then adding addEventListener for the event click and e.target for event delegation.
                    <ul>
                        <li>document.querySelector('.alumnos-container').addEventListener('click', e => {if (e.target.classList.contains('btn-eliminar')) {const alumnoContainer = e.target.closest('.alumno'); console.log('Se elimina al alumno ' + alumnoContainer.dataset.numeroDeDocumento);}});</li>
                    </ul>
                    With contains we set that we are talking about the e.target with that contains the classList 'btn-eliminar' and with .closest we look for the ascendant element with the class '.alumno'. the attribute numeroDeDocumento is created by us.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">43:00 to 50:00:</span>This way, we can program what to do when register, delete or contact a student:
                    <ul>
                        <li>First we create an event for the container document.querySelector('.alumnos-container').addEventListener('click', e => {})</li>
                        <li>Within that addEventListener we create the const alumnoContainer = e.target.closest('.alumno'); // meaning that when click it will search the closest ascendant element with the class '.alumno'.</li>
                        <li>Also, we create another const numeroDeDocumento = alumnoContainer.dataset.numeroDeDocumento; // To save the ID number of each student card clicked.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Then we set a series of if with returns to determine what will happen when we click the buttons delete, subscribe or contact:
                    <ul>
                        <li>if (e.target.classList.contains('btn-eliminar')) {eliminarAlumno(numeroDeDocumento); return;}</li>
                        <li>if (e.target.classList.contains('btn-inscribir')) {inscribirAlumno(numeroDeDocumento); return;}</li>
                        <li>if (e.target.classList.contains('btn-contactar')) {contactarAlumno(numeroDeDocumento); return;}</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">50:00 to 1:13:00:</span> We can create a builder function for the object 'alumno'. For more information about builder functions: <a href="/clase29/01-ejemplo-funciones-constructoras-1/index.html" target="_blank">Class - 29</a>. First we create a builder function to make any object 'alumno':
                    <ul>
                        <li>function Alumno (nombre, apellido, numeroDeDocumento, telefono, email, detalles) {</li>
                        <li>this.nombre = nombre;</li>
                        <li>this.apellido = apellido;</li>
                        <li>this.numeroDeDocumento = numeroDeDocumento;</li>
                        <li>this.telefono = telefono;</li>
                        <li>this.email = email;</li>
                        <li>this.detalles = detalles;}</li>
                    </ul>
                    Then we set the addEventListener for the container with the class '.alumnos-container' and within we create the const alumnoContainer, calling with e.target, the closest element with the class '.alumno'. Now, from this const we set the other properties of the object: name, lasName, phone, email. And finally create a variable let for alumno, using the operator new to create a new one with the data stored in each variable. Something like this:
                    <ul>
                        <li>const alumnoContainer = e.target.closest('.alumno');</li>
                        <li>const numeroDeDocumento = alumnoContainer.dataset.numeroDeDocumento;</li>
                        <li>const nombre = alumnoContainer.dataset.nombre;</li>
                        <li>const apellido = alumnoContainer.dataset.apellido;</li>
                        <li>const telefono = alumnoContainer.dataset.telefono;</li>
                        <li>const email = alumnoContainer.dataset.email;</li>
                        <li>let alumno = new Alumno(nombre, apellido, numeroDeDocumento, telefono, email, 'detalles');</li>
                    </ul>
                    And with the set of if we program each button, using in this case the object 'alumno':
                    <ul>
                        <li>if (e.target.classList.contains('btn-eliminar')) {eliminarAlumno(alumno);return;}</li>
                        <li>if (e.target.classList.contains('btn-inscribir')) {inscribirAlumno(alumno);return;}</li>
                        <li>if (e.target.classList.contains('btn-contactar')) {contactarAlumno(alumno);return;}</li>
                    </ul>
                    To avoid that when we click outside an '.alumno' element the console shows an error, we can set an if to stablish that when alumnoContainer doesn't existe, do not exacute the fuction, using a return, like this: if (!alumnoContainer) {return;}
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:13:00 to 1:25:00:</span> The following list is the same as above:

                            <li>const numeroDeDocumento = alumnoContainer.dataset.numeroDeDocumento;</li>
                            <li>const nombre = alumnoContainer.dataset.nombre;</li>

                            <li>const telefono = alumnoContainer.dataset.telefono;</li>
                            <li>const email = alumnoContainer.dataset.email;</li>
                            <li>let alumno = new Alumno(nombre, apellido, numeroDeDocumento, telefono, email, 'detalles');</li>
                        </ul>
                        It can be reduce by this:
                        <ul>
                            <li>const {numeroDeDocumento, nombre, apellido, telefono: telefonoPrincipal, email, localidad = 'CABA', provincia} = alumnoContainer.dataset;</li>
                        </ul>
                        <strong>This is called object destructuring</strong>. Another Example
                        <ul>
                            <li>const color = producto.color</li>
                            <li>const precio = producto.precio</li>
                            <li>const marca = producto.marca</li>
                            <li>const {color, precio, marca} = producto; // This is the same as above.</li>
                        </ul>
                        If we have data that doesn't exist we create them and use a default value, as in localidad = 'CABA', it will be use if there is not a value for that property. We can also change the name of the properties ofr dataset, using colons (:), like this: phone: mainPhone. This way it will take the phone data, but using the new name mainPhone.

                    <li><span class="hour">1:26:00 to 2:40:00:</span> Flexbox. Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for arranging items in rows or columns. Items flex (expand) to fill additional space or shrink to fit into smaller spaces. When working with flexbox we first set a container (usually called .flex-container) with the property display: flex. Hence, when display: flex is activated we can add all other properties of flexbox. Here an image of the different examples:
                        <div class="image-container"><img src="images/css-flexbox.png" alt="CSS Flexbox" class="image-container__image"></div>

                            <dd>By default has the value normal: justify-content: normal; but can include the following values for positional alignment: 
                                <ul>
                                    <li>justify-content: center;     /* Pack items around the center */</li>
                                    <li>justify-content: start;      /* Pack items from the start */</li>
                                    <li>justify-content: end;        /* Pack items from the end */</li>
                                    <li>justify-content: flex-start; /* Pack flex items from the start */</li>
                                    <li>justify-content: flex-end;   /* Pack flex items from the end */</li>
                                    <li>justify-content: left;       /* Pack items from the left */</li>
                                    <li>justify-content: right;      /* Pack items from the right */</li>
                                </ul>
                                And these ones for distributed alignment:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>justify-content: space-between; /* Distribute items evenly The first item is flush with the start, the last is flush with the end */</li>
                                    <li>justify-content: space-around;  /* Distribute items evenly Items have a half-size spaceon either end */</li>
                                    <li>justify-content: space-evenly;  /* Distribute items evenly Items have equal space around them */</li>
                                    <li>justify-content: stretch;       /* Distribute items evenly Stretch 'auto'-sized items to fit the container */</li>

                            In Flexbox, it controls the alignment of items on the Cross Axis. The following are the basic keywords:

                <ul>
                    <li><span class="hour">00:00 to 31:00:</span> The CSS link has the attribute media that can be set for screen or for print. By default is set in "all" media="all", but it is not showed. There are others as braile, but screen and print are the most used:
                    <ul>
                        <li>link rel="stylesheet" href="css/estilos_general.css"</li>
                        <li>link rel="stylesheet" href="css/estilos_pantalla.css" media="screen"</li>
                        <li>link rel="stylesheet" href="css/estilos_impresion.css" media="print"</li>
                    </ul>
                    Some CSS style using nav:hover, text-decoration for the links, background-color, position the navigation bar with fixed. With media we can set what styles we want to be shown in screens or Print
                    <ul>
                        <li>@media screen {h1 {font-style: italic;} h2 {border: 7px solid; padding: .2em;}}</li>
                        <li>@media print {p {text-align: center;}}</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">31:00 to 36:00:</span> max-width can be used to determine styles at specific device sizes:
                    <ul>
                        <li>@media (max-width: 768px) {h1 {background-color: orange; text-decoration: underline;} p {color: olivedrab;}}</li>
                        <li>@media (max-width: 595px) {h1 {background-color: yellow;}</li>
                        <li>@media (max-width: 425px) {p {text-align: left;} h1 {background-color: pink;}}</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">36:00 to 40:00:</span> We can connect our phone to the PC, for that we have to open the command terminal cmd with Windows + R, also called symbols of system and typing if Windows ipconfig, if Linux ifconfig, enter. Then, almost at the end we will find the real ip address of our device: It says IPv4 with a number like 192.168.100.5. We use that number to open from our cell the LiveServer. We put the modify the first part of the URL with the IPv4, deleting the 127.0.0.1, while we have the same wi-fi network and LiveServer on.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">41:00 to 46:00:</span> More about @media (max-width). The order is important because the different styles can overlap others. So is important to order the max-width from the biggest to the smallest. With min-width will be the opposite, from the smallest to the biggest.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">46:00 to 58:00:</span> An approach to responsive designing. Using @media we can set some modifications when page dimensions change. For example determining a lower value for margins when max-width: 595px, as follows:
                        <ul>
                            <li>@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {h1 {color: red;} body {margin-left: 4em; margin-right: 4em;} .main-wrapper {flex-direction: column;} .publicidad {display: none;}} // The expression screen and (max-width: 768px) is a condition to apply the media changes just in screens at those dimensions. In dimensions lower than 768px the h1 will be red, flex-direction orders the items top to bottom (in a column) and with display we hid the add.</li>
                            <li>@media (max-width: 595px) {body {margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;} section {padding: 0;}} // When dimensions are lower than 595px the body change its margins and sections have no padding.</li>
                        </ul>
                        We can also decide not to show the adds when print:
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li>@media print {.publicidad {display: none;}}</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">59:00 to 1:42:00:</span> Hierarchy and specificity. Specificity determines which style to apply by the number of selectors of each weight category. For example:
                        <ul>
                            <li>section // This selector will apply the styles to all section elements</li>
                            <li>section article p // This selector is more specific than the above so it has more weight and its styles will be applied over the section styles</li>
                        </ul>
                        In the case of hierarchy. this is the order of hierarchy's selectors: 
                        !important > estilos en l√≠nea > #id > .clase/pseudo-clase > etiqueta/pseudo-elementos, or in a list:
                        <ol>
                            <li>!important</li>
                            <li>estilos en l√≠nea</li>
                            <li>#id</li>
                            <li>.clase/pseudo-clase</li>
                            <li>etiqueta/pseudo-elementos</li>
                        </ol>
                        There are some specificity calculator websites, like: <a href="https://specificity.keegan.st/" target="_blank">https://specificity.keegan.st/</a>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:43:00 to 2:03:00:</span> Properties of lists. List vignettes are located in the padding zone, but it can be change with list-style-position: inside. We can modigy the properties of lists using li {list-style-type}:
                        <ul>
                            <li>list-style-type: disc; // By default</li>
                            <li>list-style-type: none; // Hid the vignettes</li>
                            <li>list-style-type: square;</li>
                            <li>list-style-type: circle;</li>
                            <li>list-style-position: outside; // By default</li>
                            <li>list-style-position: inside;</li>
                            <li>list-style-image: url('img/grande.png'); // To add an image instead of a vignette.</li>
                            <li>.lista5 li {background-image: url('img/grande.png'); background-repeat: no-repeat; background-size: 8px auto; background-position: left 5px center; margin: 5px 0; /* border: 4px solid red; *//* list-style-position: inside; */ padding-left: 15px;} // To add a background-image and located before the element. It's frecuently used.</li>
                            <li>.lista6 {padding: 3em; list-style-position: inside; list-style-image: url('img/star-1.png');} // Another example for adding an image instead of a vignette.</li>
                            <li>.lista6 li:nth-child(2) {list-style-image: url('img/star-2.png');} // Adding the image vignette to nth-child(2), that means the child number two.</li>
                            <li>.lista6 li:nth-child(2):hover {list-style-image: url('img/star-1.png');} // Adding the image vignette to nth-child(2) when hover.</li>
                        </ul>
                        For ordered lists we can set different vignettes like the following;
                        <ul>
                            <li>list-style-type: lower-hebrew; // Vignettes in hebrew characters ◊ê◊ë◊í◊ì◊î</li>
                            <li>list-style-type: lower-greek; // Vignettes in greek characters Œ±Œ≤Œ≥Œ¥Œµ</li>
                            <li>list-style-type: armenian; // Vignettes to armenian characters ‘±‘≤‘≥‘¥‘µ</li>
                            <li>list-style-type: lower-alpha; // Vignettes in lowercases letters</li>
                            <li>list-style-type: upper-alpha; // Vignettes in uppercases letters</li>
                            <li>list-style-type: lower-roman; // Vignettes in lower roman numbers</li>
                            <li>list-style-type: upper-roman; // Vignettes in upper roman numbers</li>
                            <li>list-style-type: decimal; // By default</li>
                            <li>ol ol {list-style-type: lower-roman;} // To put style in list inside another list.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <strong>List are the conventional form to make navigate menus in websites.</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:03:00 to 2:38:00:</span>Mobile first and the BEM naming convention. Until now we were working with a desktop first approach (from big to small design), but mobile first is from small to big design. It's recommended to use mobile first because nowadays internet is more used from cellphones than any other media. When designing a website is typical to set main with max-width: 1200px;, letting header and footer by default in 100%. In mobile first it's common to order navigate items in columns. When we're working with mobile first designing we use the property min-width instead of max-width used for desktop first. Also its important to set a max-width to the main-nav__list, hence when growing the dimension items stay together and not tend to separate too much. So, some examples for styling a navigation bar using mobile first.

                <h3>Timeline and notes Class 41.</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="hour">00:00 to 23:00:</span> Defining the skeleton of the integrator project:
                    <ol>
                        <li>To build the main structure website // Juan creates the skeleton.</li>
                        <li>Create the pages for an e-commerce with products to sell.</li>
                        <li>Create a Buy button depending on the time.</li>
                        <li>Create a list of items to purchase in the HTML and CSS.</li>
                        <li>In other stage those list elements will be created by JavaScript in the front-end side, using an array of objects (products), to show them in the front-end dinamically.</li>
                        <li>The final idea is to create that list of items from a set of products that we have in a database // That means, the products we create in the HTML as an example will be created using a register page where we will define the inputs to complete, name, price, branch, etc. That info goes to a database and it will be show in the main page of the website.</li>
                        <li>We will be able to list and modify the items using CRUD (Create, read, update and delete), in spanish is <i>ABM (Alta, Baja y Modificaci√≥n)</i>.</li>
                        <li>The topic is a toy store, named <em>"Jugueter√≠a C√≥smica"</em></li>
                        <li>We will have to create the logo that must looks great in small and big.</li>
                        <li>We will need to chose the palette of colors with <a href="https://coolors.co/" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/</a>. Should be live coloors.</li>
                        <li>Take into account the time and the client specifications.</li>
                        <li>Look for examples in hebrew, the elements in the page, if there are adds, videos, pictures.</li>
                        <li>So, with HTML and CSS we will design at the beginning all the website with some guidelines</li>
                        <li>We are allow to add any more coding to the HTML but not to delete anything.</li>
                        <li>We are allow to add any more coding to the HTML but not to delete anything.</li>
                        <li>
                            The website will have 4 pages, and we can add others.
                            <ol>
                                <li>The main page // With the cards with the toy items.</li>
                                <li>A second page for register // With a form to put name, price, branch of a new product we want to add. Eventually this will works to register a new item.</li>
                                <li>Contact // With another form for the clients</li>
                                <li>Us // Free to add what we want to create. We can write about the company or about us.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>All pages will share the same navigation bar and footer.</li>
                        <li>We will use cloud stored services as GitHub, and depending on the time Glitch or Heroku (Now is a payid service).</li>
                        <li>We still have a service of free hosting with IT Education</li>
                        <li>There are three deliveries. The first one is just HTML and CSS, using SASS. We can be modifying the structure in the process.</li>
                    </ol>
                    The idea with the full stack development is to have the ability to create all aspects of a webpage.

We will design the cards with the standard structure. Putting in Google <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=css+cards&oq=css+cards&aqs=edge.0.0i512l8j69i64.1637j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">CSS Cards</a> and we can find some examples as <a href="https://freefrontend.com/css-cards/" target="_blank">https://freefrontend.com/css-cards/</a>, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_cards.asp" target="_blank">https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_cards.asp</a>, but we will need to adapt the designs to the structure, being very detailed. In <a href="https://freefrontend.com/css-cards/" target="_blank">https://freefrontend.com/css-cards/</a> there are some crazy and amazing things. But KISS, Keep it simple stupid.</li> 
                    <li><span class="hour">40:00 to 1:07:00:</span> BEM naming using container elements, a elements are line elements that can have block elements inside, but we cannot put interactive elements within, for that reason it's better to use div containers and add the elements. <strong>Now, for making all the card clikeable using an "a" element we can use the properties display: block; position: absolute and the container with position: relative; and filling the container space using top: 0; rigth: 0; left: 0; bottom: 0. If we want to put an input type button within the card, then we can use the ZIndex to put the button in front </strong>. An example of this can be found in <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/helpers/stretched-link/" target="_blank">https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/helpers/stretched-link/</a></li>
                    <li><span class="hour">56:00 to 1:13:00:</span> BEM stands for Block, Element, Modifiers. For more information <a href="https://getbem.com/introduction/" target="_blank">https://getbem.com/introduction/</a> and <a href="https://getbem.com/naming/" target="_blank">https://getbem.com/naming/</a>:

                            <li><b>Block</b> is a standalone (in spanish: <i>"ser √∫nico o aut√≥nomo"</i>) entity that is meaningful on its own. Examples: `header`, `container`, `menu, `checkbox`, `input`.</li>
                            <li><b>Element</b> is a part of a block that has no standalone meaning and is semantically tied to its block. Examples `menu item`, `list item`, `checkbox caption`, `header title`.</li>
                            <li><b>Modifier</b> a flag on a block or element. Use them to change appearance or behavior, for the block or its parts. Examples `disabled`, `highlighted`, `checked`, `fixed`, `size big`, `color yellow`</li>

                        Website recommended for BEM <a href="https://9elements.com/bem-cheat-sheet/" target="_blank">https://9elements.com/bem-cheat-sheet/</a>. Some generic examples of the use of BEM are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>.block {}</li>
                            <li>.block__element1 {}</li>

                        </ul>
                        BEM has sense when is used with SASS.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:13:00 to 1:17:00:</span> Hence the cards will have the following structure:
                    
                        <ul>
                            <li>&lt;div class="card"&gt;</li>
                            <li>&lt;a class="card_link-add-to-cart" href=""&lt;comprar&gt;/a&lt;</li>
                            <li>&lt;article class="card__article"&gt;</li>
                            <li>&lt;div&gt; class="card__image-container"&gt;</li>
                            <li>&lt;img class="card__image" src="img/productos/chormecast.jpg" alt=""&gt;</li>
                            <li>&lt;/div&gt;</li>
                            <li>&lt;div&gt; class="card__content"&gt;</li>
                            <li>&lt;h2&lt; class="card__heading">Juguete&gt;/h2&gt;</li>
                            <li>&lt;p&lt; class="card__description">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.&gt;/p&gt;</li>
                            <li>&lt;/div&gt;</li>
                            <li>&lt;/article&gt;</li>
                            <li>&lt;/div&gt;</li>
                        </ul>
                        We can modify the text in card__heading: Juguete and the card__description text.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:17:00 to 1:24:00:</span> With BEM we shall also put a class to main: main class="main". Now, we're also woing to work with normalize. <a href="https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/" target="_blank">https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/</a>. Normalize.css makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. It precisely targets only the styles that need normalizing. So we click download and we can just save the file using Ctrl + S and put it in the project folder. For the moment we use the files free in the folders, but in some moment we will use a folder to order them.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:25:00 to 2:01:00:</span> The universal selector * not apply styles to all the element in the page, it misses the pseudoclasses ::after and ::before, for that reason we must add those when using the universal selector if we really want to apply styles to all the page elements. Now, adding some styles to the cards-container:
                    <ul>
                        <li>.cards-container { /*border: 4px solid red; */ padding: 1em; display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 1em;  justify-content: center; align-items: stretch; } // A little of padding, using flex box with display: flex and flex wrap, and adding a gap (that means an space between items), and also justify-content: center and align-items: stretch.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>Then we may need that the cards grow to occupy the space inside the container, so we can use flex-grow: 1, that is a possibility, we can also use a max-width: 10em, for example to let them grow just a little until a new card enters in the space when the resolution is growing</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>.card {/*border: 5px solid green; */ width: 10em; flex-grow: 0; box-shadow: 1px 3px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 0 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, .05); border-radius: 5px 5px 0 0 ; /*height: 200px; */ /*transition: height .3s, background-color 3s; */  transition: all .2s;} // With transition we can set that some style take some time to be applied, that way we can add some "movement" to the card, we can use transition to set a time for background-color, height or for all the properties of a selector. The two shadows help to do a more realistic effect.</li>
                    </ul>
                    A small cellphone has 320px resolutions, that's very small, less than that could be a smart watch. <em>At 1:42:00 some comments about dinner and food in Colombia and Argentina</em>. The use of transition, important not to exaggerate. We can't transition all properties, they have to have a numerical value, we can not transition between font families, so we can transition colors (they are in deed numbers) and properties for measurements as width, height, size and others. So wen hover height: 300px the element without hover must have a height value different to auto, because auto is not a value for transitioning. We must contemplate or think about the need or practicity of using height in the cards. Also, we can use transform. Tranform has a lot of functions:
                    <ul>
                        <li>none</li>
                        <li>perspective()</li>
                        <li>rotate()</li>
                        <li>rotate3d()</li>
                        <li>rotateX('angle') // rotateX(-20deg)</li>
                        <li>rotateY('angle')</li>
                        <li>rotateZ('angle')</li>
                        <li>scale('times') // scale(1.7), means grow 1.7 times</li>
                        <li>scale3d()</li>
                        <li>scaleX() // We can set scaleX(1.7) scaleY(1.3) at the same time</li>
                        <li>scaleY()</li>
                        <li>scaleZ()</li>
                        <li>skewX('angle') // skewX(3deg) to decline the form of the element</li>
                        <li>transform-origin: right bottom // Determines where the effect will begin.</li>
                    </ul>
                    We can set transform in hover and the nice part is that transform hasn't any impact in the other elements.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:01:00 to 2:33:00:</span> We have to be careful when slecting the kind of image, or images with transparency or .png or images that cover all the container space. Now, to give styles to the cards in multiples of five we use the advanced pseudoclass nth-child(), like this:
                        <ul>
                            <li>.card:nth-child(5n+1) {background: linear-gradient(to bottom, hsl(300, 30%, 55%) 0%, hsl(300, 30%, 40%) 100%);}</li>
                            <li>.card:nth-child(5n+2) {background: linear-gradient(to bottom, hsl(350, 30%, 55%) 0%, hsl(350, 30%, 40%) 100%);}</li>
                            <li>.card:nth-child(5n+3) {background: linear-gradient(to bottom, hsl(250, 30%, 55%) 0%, hsl(250, 30%, 40%) 100%);}</li>
                            <li>.card:nth-child(5n+4) {background: linear-gradient(to bottom, hsl(200, 30%, 55%) 0%, hsl(200, 30%, 40%) 100%);background-color: #F6F2CF;}</li>
                            <li>.card:nth-child(5n+5) {background: linear-gradient(to bottom, hsl(250, 30%, 55%) 0%, hsl(250, 30%, 40%) 100%);background-color: #E3F3D8;}</li>
                        </ul>
                        The background-color used shall be extremely calm. For that purpose we can use <a href="https://coolors.co/palettes/popular" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/palettes/popular</a>. This one can be a good option <a href="https://coolors.co/palette/fec5bb-fcd5ce-fae1dd-f8edeb-e8e8e4-d8e2dc-ece4db-ffe5d9-ffd7ba-fec89a" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/palette/fec5bb-fcd5ce-fae1dd-f8edeb-e8e8e4-d8e2dc-ece4db-ffe5d9-ffd7ba-fec89a</a>. We can also use gradients using <a href="https://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/" target="_blank">https://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/</a> and the property linear-gradient, like in the examples above: background: linear-gradient(to bottom, hsl(200, 30%, 55%) 0%, hsl(200, 30%, 40%) 100%);background-color: #F6F2CF;. The background-color works as a backup if the gradient doesn't work. Cards are frequently use for e-commerce websites. We have to be careful with the texts in the images. Everything enters by the eyes. Search beautiful images. The barbie toy, or everything we want. We should use a folder named products inside the folder img. To handle the size of the images we can set a fixed height for the container, for example: .card__image-container {heigth: 20em;}; and in the element img with the class .card__image we can use the property object-fit. This property has several values:
                        <ul>
                            <li>object-fit: fill;</li>
                            <li>object-fit: contain; // It could be very useful for the cards, because contains the image inside the container.</li>
                            <li>object-fit: cover; // It could be very useful for the cards.</li>
                            <li>object-fit: none;</li>
                            <li>object-fit: scale-down;</li>
                        </ul>
                        As global values object-fit has:

                        </ul>
                        With object-fit the image behaves as a background-image. For more information about object-fit: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit" target="_blank">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit</a>.
                        With .png images, could be useful to apply a background-color with a neutral color, as a gray: #303030;

                    <li><span class="hour">00:00 to 1:40:00:</span> Questions about the integrator project. Making the main-header, the main-footer is let free for us to do what we want. Emmet for the main-nav__items: li*4.main-nav__item>a.main-nav__link[href=#]{Texto}. We can use the display:: flex with flex-wrap: wrap to make the nav to go down when there's no space, and flex-basis: 100% to occupy all the space of the row. The list has several elements:
                    <ul>
                        <li>.main-header__main-nav-container {display: none;} // Navigation bar should be shown when the user clicks the hamburger button, to achive that we hid the nav with display none</li>
                        <li>.main-nav {}</li>
                        <li>.main-nav__list {list-style-type: none; // To take off the vignettes. margin: 0; padding: 0;}</li>
                        <li>.main-nav__item {}</li>
                        <li>.main-nav__link {display: block; width 100%} // That way links occupy all the space of its container element.</li>
                        <li>.main-nav__link:hover {}</li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong>To show the nav when the user clicks the hamburger button, first we create an input: &lt;input type="checkbox" id="main-nav-toggle" class="main-nav-toggle"&gt;. We can not add to much styles to input elements, some new features are accent-color: magenta; to change the color of the input when is checked, also we can add a shadow with box-shadow: 1px 1px 3px blue. Now, for example we can set that the input element has shadow when checked, like this: main-nav-toggle:checked {box-shadow: 1px 1px 3px blue}. Now, we can add styles to other elements using checked, like this: .main-nav-toggle:checked ~ .main-header {border: 10px dotted pink}; this will add a border to all the adjacent siblings of .main-nav-toggle with the class .main-header. With this same logic we can apply, add or remove the property display to the main-nav-container: .main-nav-toggle:checked ~ .main-header .main-header__main-nav-container {display: block;} and to use an id to link the input to the hamburger button, through a label tag, and hid the input with display: none. Hence, when clicking the hamburger button it will appear the navigation bar.</strong>. To create the three lines for the hamburger button we first create three HTML spans inside the label element:
                    <ul>
                        <li>span class="hamburger-button__top-bread"/span</li>
                        <li>span class="hamburger-button__meat"/span</li>
                        <li>span class="hamburger-button__bottom-bread"/span</li>
                    </ul>
                    And with CSS we add the styles to each one:
                    <ul>
                        <li>.hamburger-button__top-bread { display: block; position: absolute; width: 80%; height: .3em; background-color: #1a1a1a; left: 10%; top: 20%; }</li>
                        <li>.hamburger-button__meat { display: block; position: absolute; width: 80%; height: .3em; background-color: #1a1a1a; transform: translateY(-50%); left: 10%; top: 50%; }</li>
                        <li>.hamburger-button__bottom-bread { display: block; position: absolute; width: 80%; height: .3em; background-color: #1a1a1a; left: 10%; bottom: 20%; }</li>
                    </ul>
                    We have to put position: relative in the hamburger-button to use the position absolute in the bread and meat elements. And to set a change the color of the hamburger button when checked we can use again the pseudoclass checked:
                    <ul>
                        <li>.main-nav-toggle:checked ~ .main-header .hamburger-button:hover {background-color: orangered;}</li>
                    </ul>
                    We can change all those styles and to adapt it to what we want.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:41:00 to 2:21:00:</span> Sass is the most mature, stable, and poweful professional grade CSS extension language in the world. It's a CSS preprocessor, and helps us to work easier with CSS. For the record, the CSS processor is the browser. <a href="https://sass-lang.com/guide" target="_blank">https://sass-lang.com/guide</a>. To apply Sass we can use the conventional and older form called Sass or the new one, easier to work called Sassy CSS or SCSS, the only difference is the use of brackets; for us will be easier to use brackets to work with the VS Code files. With Sass we can organize in an easier and intuitive way the descendant selector, instead of writing nav ul {margin: 0}; nav li {display: inline-block}; we can put everything inside the selector nav, like this: nav { ul {margin: 0} li {display: inline-block}. This way it will be easier to understand the code and work with it. That is called nesting. So, the normal way to work is to divide the CSS files in several parts, so we're going to have a file for the header, another one for the hamburguer and nav, another one for the cards and so on. But, ideally the server should ask just once for this data, so it's better to have just one big file with all the information the browser needs. Sass compile all those files in just a big one, that is called partials. Mixing are like JavaScript functions that let us make groups of CSS declarations that we want to reuse throughout our site, for example: @mixin theme($theme: DarkGray) { background: $theme; box-shadow: 0 0 1px rgba($theme, .25); color: #fff;}, and then we call the theme after, like this: .info {@include theme;} .alert {@include theme($theme: DarkRed);} .success {@include theme($theme: DarkGreen);}</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:52:00 to 2:20:00:</span> We can install Sass by Applications or by Command Line. It's more recommended to use Command Lines, because are faster to work with when we have repetitive tasks to do. But the first contact with Sass will be with <a href="https://codepen.io/" target="_blank">https://codepen.io/</a>. Click Start Coding and in Pen Settings chose in CSS Sass or SCSS, recommended. We can see There are other preprocessors, as <a href="https://lesscss.org/" target="_blank">https://lesscss.org/</a>. Between Sass and Less Juan says Sass is more powerful. Well, in Pen Settings we can also check the normalize as a CSS Base. Then we can work with codepen and see how SCSS works and view the compiled code. The compiled code is not editable. A useful tool we have with Sass is that the classes within the brackets can be replace by the generic symbol &. So, we can have .card { &__article {}}; and when compiled it will looks as .card {} card__article {}; totally ordered, and if we change the name of .card it will replace the name in all the ampersands. So Sass is thought for working with BEM. And we can nest and ampersand inside another ampersand and will take the parent expression. We can say we are in a period of CSS evolving to apply styles as Sass does, its like what happend with bootstrap when they simplify in a simple way to define the page lay out, then CSS took that and developed flexbox. <strong>The main use we will do to Sass is to organize selectors in this way and to separate the CSS styles in small files.</strong> Codepen is a useful tool, we should register and use it, we can create projects, copy the link and share it with anybody.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:21:00 to 2:30:00:</span> Other form to use Sass is with the VS Code extension Live Sass Compiler. It's not recommended by Juan, it works, but has not all functionalities. We can install the extension but we need to modify the JSON file in VS Code and add the code:
                    "liveSassCompile.settings.formats": [
                        {
                            "format": "expanded",
                            "extensionName": ".css",
                            "savePath": "./css"
                        }
                    ],</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:30:00 to 2:37:00:</span> Sass Test. When working with Sass we don't touch the style.css file, just the SASS file file.scss. After we code in the file.scss we click Watch Sass and it will create three files within the folder of the project. The extension is an intermediate point between codepen and the installation of Sass.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><span class="hour">00:00 to 57:00:</span> To separate the CSS files with sens we let that work to Sass, creating multiple Sass files, but creating just one CSS file. For that purpose we shall use some patterns as Sass 7-1 pattern <a href="https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/user-interfaces/building-layouts-preprocessors/7-1-sass-architecture" target="_blank">https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/user-interfaces/building-layouts-preprocessors/7-1-sass-architecture</a>. 7 - 1 stands for 7 folder and 1 file. The folders proposed are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>abstract // For functions, as the theme example.</li>
                        <li>vendors // For files developed for externals, the developments in here do not depend on us, examples: bootstrap.</li>
                        <li>base // The minimal or fundamentals, as reset (universal styles), typography, normalize.</li>
                        <li>layout // The structure of the site: nav bars, headers, footers, etc.</li>
                        <li>components // Like mini layouts, styles for reusable pieces of the site as buttons, forms, profile pictures.</li>
                        <li>pages // Specific styles for each page.</li>
                        <li>themes // As dark mode or night mode, admin and default themes</li>
                        <li>main.scss</li>
                    </ul>
                    All these folders inside a folder called sass. This is a good practice suggestion.

Watch out with the examples because they use @import, and the <a href="https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/import" target="_blank">official documentation of Sass</a> discourages the continued use of the @import rule. Sass will gradually phase it out over the next few years, and eventually remove it from the language entirely. Prefer the @use rule instead. Creating the folders and the files for the 7 - 1 pattern in the integrator project.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">58:00 to 1:49:00:</span> Installation of Sass using Command Line. The Sass page offers several ways to do it, by downloading the package from GitHub and adding it to our PATH, or by Node.js npm (something Juan will explain later), Chocolatey for Windows or Homebrew for Mac OS X or Linux. After downloading the file from GitHub dart-sass-1.55.0-windows-x64.zip we locate the folder in disc C. Then we open the Windows PowerShell. With command lines we can do a lote of things as creating new folders and files faster than graphic interfaces. They are so powerful and as programmers we must know them and master them. In the PowerShell some commands are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>calc // opens the calculator</li>
                            <li>notepad // opens the notepad</li>
                            <li>ls // lists files in a folder</li>
                            <li>cd // abbreviation for change directoy</li>
                            <li>cd folder name // enters to the folder, using tab autocompletes</li>
                            <li>cls // to clean. Stands for clear screen, another option is just the word clear</li>
                            <li>arrow-up and arrow-down // shows the last words typed.</li>
                            <li>rm file name // to delete a file. Stands for remove. It puts the name with backslash, like this .\notas.txt</li>
                            <li>cd .. // for go up. Also we can use in windows cd.. without space. In linux is necessary the space.</li>
                            <li>cd folder name\folder name\folder name // For going several folders down.</li>
                            <li>cd ..\..\.. // For going several folders up.</li>
                            <li>rm .\blablabla // works when the folder is empty. But rm is to delete files. If the folder has a file it will ask that folder has secondary elements, [Y] OR [N]</li>
                            <li>Ctrl + C // To get out of something we're doing.</li>
                            <li>C:\dart-sass> .\sass.bat --version // Shows the version 1.55.0</li>
                            <li>C:\dart-sass> .\sass.bat // Show the info about sass. The idea is not to have to open the folder to execute it.</li>
                            <li>exit // to close the terminal</li>
                            <li>From the Command Lines we can access the project integrator project by putting the address in quotes: cd "C:\Users\Dario Ernesto\OneDrive\Protalento Fullstack Software Developer\bootcamp-fullstack\proyecto_integrador"</li>
                            <li>Also we can open the terminal directly from the folder we want to open clicking open with. Also, pressing Shift and rigth click.</li>
                            <li><strong>sass origin-file.scss detiny-file.css // To compile in the terminal</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>sass sass\main.scss css\main.css // To compile in the terminal in the case of the real files of the integrator project</strong>. That creates to files in the folder css a main.css and a main.css.map</li>
                            <li>sass sass\main.scss css\main.css -w // -w is a command that stands for watching, when we put them in the end of the command line keeps the terminal reloading any change we make in the sass files. We stop it with Ctrl + C</li>
                            <li>sass sass:css // Compile all files within the sass folder and create new css files from them in the css folder.</li>
                        </ul>
                        We have to put in path the route C:\dart-sass in System Environment Variables.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:50:00 to 2:32:00:</span> After the creation of the sass files we don't need to touch the main.css file. If we have a syntax error everything breaks down. It indicates where is the error, for example in the file _main-header.scss 11:12 (that means row 11, column 12). We can look for it with Ctrl + G and typing :11:12, brings us to the exact place. When working is normal that things like that happens.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:57:00 to 2:30:00:</span> Now, VS Code has its own terminal. Pressing Ctrl + √ë, ot in View/Terminal (Ctrl + √ë). It has Powershell and other options. There we can code the command lines to set the terminal in watching. Now, the underscores indicate that files are partials and they are not directly compiled. Now when I inspect an element and the browser shows me in what line is the style in the main.css, that won't be pretty useful, because I need to know the location in the scss uncompiled files to do the changes. For that we have the .map file, that allows the browser to locate the scss file where the style is coded. When pressing F5 and refreshing, it should show the folders and lines for each style rule. Then we order the selectors with BEM in each scss file, putting any element within its block and using ampersand &.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:33:00 to 2:37:00:</span> For the card we should use img elements, because they are informative elements, they bring user relevant information. When we going to add image URLs to the scss files we must use the URL as we were in the main.css file, looking for the img folder as if we were in main.css, like this: background-image: url('../img/');</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:37:00 to 2:40:00:</span> Questions about the project. We can add modifiers, for example: main-header__logo-container--white, we can create new containers, new div elements, we have to delete the logo and the form texts, also the card emoji, the descriptions and the name of the toys, we will be able to add new content. We cannot change the name of the classes, but we can add others. Any style added should be applied with sass, naming with BEM rules, locating the scss files in the correspondent folder.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:41:00 to 2:44:00:</span> Farewell.</li>

                    <li><span class="hour">00:00 to 20:00:</span> Questions about the integrator project, validations of forms, the links for cards, hamburguer button, the reason to draw the hamburguer button with CSS is to add animation and to make it for adjustable, so it could be transform in a cross. It is possible to use canvas to draw it, that's something we won't see. Good site web shared by a classmate: <a href="https://jonsuh.com/hamburgers/#usage" target="_blank">https://jonsuh.com/hamburgers/#usage</a></li>
                    <li><span class="hour">20:00 to 58:00:</span> For and while can have no body, it's not common, but possible. 
                    <ol>
                        <li>First, we create a function for assigning it to a variable const getRandomNumber = () => Math.round(Math.random()*100); // Math.random creates a random number from 0 to 1 in decimals (0.164523549864, 0.4795486465478), when multiply by 100 they become in numbers between 0 to 100 (16.4523549864, 47.95486465478) and within Math.round they are rounded to a integer between 0 to 100 (16, 48).</li>
                        <li>Second, we create the variables let number = 93; and let i = 1</li>
                        <li>Third, we create the for without an initializer and without a counter: for (___; number !== getRandomNumber();___) {console.log(i); i++} // The code will be executed as many times as the random number is different to 93. Outside the for we initialize the i = 1, to watch how many time is executed, we can also pit the initilizer and the counter within the for's parentheses.</li>
                    </ol>
                    Now, to make a function getRandomBoolean we can do as follows:
                    <ol>
                        <li>First we create a function for assigning it to a variable const getRandomBoolean = () => {const randomNumber = Math.round(Math.random()*100);}</li>
                        <li>Second we set a conditional if (randomNumber > 50) {return true;} else {return false;} // Half of time it will return true and half of time it will retirn false.</li>
                        <li>This conditional can be make shorter just putting return randomNumber > 95; // Because randomNumber > 95 will result in true or false.</li>
                    </ol>
                    When writing a for, if we write a semicolon nothing happens, like this: for (;) {}, but if we put another one: for (;;) {}, it will hang the browser, at least we put for ( ; false ; ) {}. Now, continuing with this wear explanation, a while an have as condition a functions call, like this:
                    <ul>
                        <li>let number = 0;</li>
                        <li>while (getRandomBoolean()) {console.log(++number)}</li>
                    </ul>
                    Or a while without body:
                    <ol>
                        <li>First we create a function const printRandomBoolean = () => {const randomBoolean = getRandomBoolean(); return randomBoolean;}</li>
                        <li>Then we just call the function within the while's condition: while (randomBoolean ()) { /*Without code*/} // In this cases we can delete the brackets, like this: while (randomBoolean)</li>
                    </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">58:00 to 1:35:00:</span> Synchronic code, or blocking code. Throughout the course we were coding synchronic code. Synchronous, according to MDN, <em>refers to real-time communication where each party receives (and if necessary, processes and replies to) messages instantly (or as near to instantly as possible). A human example is the telephone ‚Äî during a telephone call you tend to respond to another person immediately. Many programming commands are also synchronous ‚Äî for example when you type in a calculation, the environment will return the result to you instantly, unless you program it not to.</em> An example of it is using a for big number in the condition, as 3e9 (that's the same as 3000000000):
                    <ul>
                        <li>for (let i = 0; i < 3e9; i++);</li>
                    </ul>
                    We can also make numbers in JavaScript like this: 45_000 (that's the same as 45000), 45_0_0_0 (45000), 38_000_000 (38000000), it helps for human reading. Now, if we put that for within a function:
                    <ul>
                        <li>function delaySync () {for (let i = 0; i < 3e9; i++);} // It will take a while for being executed.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Then we can call the function delaySync() inside another one, like a serial of steps to simulate a heavy process:
                        <ul>
                            <li>function startTasksSync() { // Function start synchoric task</li>
                            <li>console.error('Inicio de tareas');
                                <ul>
                                    <li>console.warn('>> Inicia tarea A');</li>
                                    <li>console.log('>> Tarea A - Paso 1:'); delaySync();</li>
                                    <li>console.log('>> Tarea A - Paso 2:'); delaySync();</li>
                                    <li>console.log('>> Tarea A - Paso 3:'); delaySync();</li>
                                    <li>console.log('>> Tarea A - Paso 4:'); delaySync();</li>
                                    <li>console.log('>> Tarea A - Paso 5:'); delaySync();</li>
                                    <li>console.log('>> >> Fin de Tarea A');</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>console.warn('>> Inicia tarea B');
                                <ul>
                                    <li>console.log('>> Tarea B - Paso 1:'); delaySync();</li>
                                    <li>console.log('>> Tarea B - Paso 2:'); delaySync();</li>
                                    <li>console.log('>> Tarea B - Paso 3:'); delaySync();</li>
                                    <li>console.log('>> Tarea B - Paso 4:'); delaySync();</li>
                                    <li>console.log('>> Tarea B - Paso 5:'); delaySync();</li>
                                    <li>console.log('>> Fin de Tarea B');</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>console.error('Otras tareas...');}</li>
                        </ul>
                        The function will be called by the button Start Task (Synchronic Code):
                        <ul>
                            <li>document.querySelector('.btn-start-tasks-sync').addEventListener('click', e => {startTasksSync();});</li>
                        </ul>
                        Now when tasks are executing and we press the button Say Hello, the browser has to wait until it finish the execution to execute the console.log('Hello'). That happens because it is synchronic code, where a task occurs after the other. The problem with this is that browser hang when are executing a task, and that's very bad in a developing process. Now the problemis that the JavaScript engine works with just one thread. <strong>Search about web workers API's</strong>. So, JavaScript is like a program inside the browser, but not just lives within te browser, it also lives in other devices. In addition to JavaScript the browser also has APIs, additional functionalities for JavaScript inside the browser, they are predetermined to do specific tasks but they're not native JavaScript, but predesign functionalities. In fact, the possibility to access to HTML elements using document.getElementById or document.querySelector, are APIs and as those, browser has a bunch of APIS ready to be used, but inside the browser. In the Command Console or PowerShell we can work with JavaScript, but we won't be able to call document.something because the object document or the object window do not exist. In that environment the API used is node. Hence, some browser's functionalities are document, window, setInterval, setTimeout (the execution of a code in an asynchronic way), or server connection APIs. So in the following example JavaScript engines use the browser API SetTimeout to read the code:
                        <ul>
                            <li>setTimeout(() => {console.log(123)}, 2000); // JavaScript give the browser the order to use the API setTimeout to count two seconds, while it keeps reading the code. That's why in the console this part of the code is showed at the end.</li>
                            <li>console.log(100);</li>
                            <li>console.log(200);</li>
                            <li>console.log(300);</li>
                            <li>console.log(400);</li>
                            <li>console.log(500);</li>
                        </ul>
                        <strong>While the browser setTimeout API is counting we can execute other things with JavaScript and it will work without problem, like pressing say Hello, because setTimeout is no blocking code, that is asynchronic code.</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:28:00 to 1:41:00:</span> Asynchronic code, or no blocking code. For this coding the perfect example is setTimeout, this instruction is asynchronic, but the code within that shall be executed when time ends is synchronic code. Example of this can be seen in <a href="clase44/02-codigo-sincronico-vs-asincronico/" target="_blank"> Class - 44: Synchronic vs asynchronic code.</a> So the only way to do asynchronic code is through APIs, setTimeout is one of them, but there are others very important to communicate with the server (e.g promises).</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:42:00 to 2:03:00:</span> When we program setTimeout in 0 seconds it will be executed after the other lines of code, because as it is explain above JavaScript orders the browser to count while it keeps reading. So, after reading, it will execute the code inside the setTimeout. So, that's a trick to execute some tasks in the order we want. But, when doing this, setting a code to be executed after another, using setTimeout and functions, we have to be careful not to make a callback hell, also called pyramid of doom.

                    <li><span class="hour">2:04:00 to 2:24:00:</span> AJAX - 1. AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. According to MDN <em>AJAX is not a technology in itself, but rather an approach to using a number of existing technologies together, including HTML or XHTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM, XML, XSLT, and most importantly the XMLHttpRequest object.</em> With AJAX we can ask for updates to the server without the need to update the entire page, that's how functions the likes in social media platforms, also when we have diferent pages in a web site, we can program JavaScript with AJAX to charge certain information of texts, colors and themes, using AJAX, so the user change from page to page without reloading. That's a way to work. We can see how AJAX works in Network, putting throtting 3G Fast to simulate an slower connection and watching the responses to any patition done to the server (Preview shows details of the response).</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:24:00 to 2:39:00:</span> How does AJAX works. weel, with the XMLHttpRequest object. First we create a variable with the function XMLHttpRequest(), like this: const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest() // the name xhr (stands for XMLHttpRequest) is a common way to call this variable, another used name is req (stands for request). It is necessary to write the upper and lowercases as same as it is. And the word new is also necessary. According to MDN <em>XMLHttpRequest (XHR) objects are used to interact with servers. You can retrieve data from a URL without having to do a full page refresh. This enables a Web page to update just part of a page without disrupting what the user is doing. XMLHttpRequest is used heavily in AJAX programming. Despite its name, XMLHttpRequest can be used to retrieve any type of data, not just XML.</em> Well the new object assign to the variable const xhr will have the property xhr.readyState and it has the following values, that means an XHR client exists in one of the following states:
                        <ul>
                            <li>0: Instance created // UNSENT. Client has been created. open() not called yet.</li>
                            <li>1: Instance setted // OPENED. open() has been called.</li>
                            <li>2: Sharing of headers between client and server // HEADERS_RECEIVED. send() has been called, and headers and status are available.</li>
                            <li>3: Transfer of information // LOADING. Downloading; responseText holds partial data.</li>
                            <li>4: End of communication (by succes or failure) // DONE. The operation is complete.</li>
                        </ul>
                    According to MDN <em>the XMLHttpRequest.readyState property returns the state an XMLHttpRequest client is in.</em> When we create the const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest() we instance create the instance. If we code xhr.open('get', 'texto.txt'), that sets the conection method and the resource we're demainding to the server, and xhr.readyState turns into the value 1. Examples of methods are in forms, due they also have the property method with the possible values 'post' (used for uploading data) or 'get' (used for searching data), there are another less used methods. The method 'get' will be always used for the resource xhr.open 'texto.txt'. When we code xhr.send() JavaScript send the order to the browser and continues reading the code. xhr.send() is asynchronic code. When we check xhr.readyState after coding xhr.send() the console will show a value of 4, that means the operation is complete, passing from 1 to 4 because is asynchronic code. To see the response we can use xhr.responseText, that will show the content of the response. We can set the time to show the response in the order we want, like this:
                    <ul>
                        <li>setTimeout(() => {console.log('xhr.readyState:', xhr.readyState); //  4</li>
                        <li>console.log('xhr.responseText:', xhr.responseText);}, 5000); //  'Hola mundo!'</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:40:00 to 2:41:00:</span> Practice: Do the same thing Juan did but with a button. When clicking the button to ask for the resource, can be an .txt file and program a setTimeout to show the response in the console. Farewell. If that works use .innerHTML to show it in a div or H1. After we will resolve this with events, just with the event will be executed certain code.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><span class="hour">00:00 to 05:00:</span> ¬øWhen do we use AJAX? Any time we want to have an update without uploading the page.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">06:00 to 32:00:</span> Some explanations about what it is XML. XML stands for Extensible Markup Language and is a data structure, like a format or language to organize data for being later analyze, it's what was used before JSON. JSON began to compete with XML and won the battle, but both of them show a set of information in form of text to be interpreted by others. A review of the methods for XMLHttpRequest:
                    <ul>
                        <li>const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest()</li>
                        <li>xhr.readyState // readyState 4 is the most important.</li>
                        <li>xhr.open</li>
                        <li>xhr.send</li>
                        <li>xhr.responseText</li>
                    </ul>
                    We can check this in the DevTools/Network, using throttling Slow 3G. It will show us the responses to our requests in a list with the columns Name, URL, Method, Status, Type, Initiator, Time, Waterfall. When the connection is slow the status and time shows (pending). After xhr.open, when pending xhr.readyState is 1, but after that, xhr.readyState is 4, that means DONE, the operation is complete. For that reason we use setTimeout to set the time in 5 seconds to receive the response and have xhr.readyState with Value 4. But we don't know what time is enough to receive the response, that's way we don't use setTimeout in this cases.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">32:00 to 45:00:</span> Besides XMLHttpRequest() we can also uses AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript) with promises, something we going to see later. With AJAX we bring additional information when is necessary.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">45:00 to 54:00:</span> Continuing with the example above. To avoid the setTimeout we can use an addEventListener for the xhr using the event readystatechange, like this:
                    <ul>
                        <li>xhr.addEventListener('readystatechange', e => {}</li>
                        <li>e.target in this case is the element XMLHttpRequest, for this case is the same xhr, we can access the same information in both cases.</li>
                        <li>We can see the change of state with console.log('e.target.readyState:', e.target.readyState);</li>
                        <li>And we can see the content of the response with e.target.responseText // it will have content only after readyState 3 and 4. When there is not to many content it appears content in readyState 3, but when the content is so much bigger may not be showed in the state 3. But it will be always shown in state 4. That's why we usually focus in state 4.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">54:00 to 55:00:</span> Now, we're going to ask if the state is 4, using an if.
                        <ul>
                            <li>xhr.addEventListener('readystatechange', e => {</li>
                            <li>console.log('Event readystatechange');</li>
                            <li>if (e.target.readyState === 4) {</li>
                            <li>console.log(e.target.responseText);}</li>
                            <li>})</li>
                        </ul>
                    The idea is to use that response to put it in the page.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">55:00 to 1:07:00:</span> Not necessarily the response we get is the response we want. We remember the resource is define in xhr.open('get', text.txt'), text.txt is the resource. The file most be in the same place to be available, not in the js folder, but aside the index.html file, where the browser is located. If there is a problem, like the file doesn't work or it named different the console will show an error but it will also return a response with HTML code. Where does that come from?, from LiveServer, it's a little code to show in the browser a little message like Cannot GET /AJAX-4/hihowareyou.html. Now the correct status is 200, that means OK, all request should be in 200. When we ask for something that does not exist in Network we will se the request red and status 404. That response created by the server or the LiveServer can be returned to us, and that is not a response we want, so we need to validate if the response is an error. But those 404 responses can be well design with pictures and next to be more friendly. So, what we can do is to use status 200 to apply a conditional and to set several orders, like this:
                        <ul>
                            <li>xhr.addEventListener('readystatechange', e => {</li>
                            <li>if (e.target.readyState === 4) {</li>
                            <li>if (e.target.status === 200) {</li>
                            <li>console.log(e.target.responseText);}</li>
                            <li>else {console.error('Communication error');}</li>
                            <li>})</li>
                        </ul>
                    <strong>"Using the keyboard abbreviation Ctrl + Alt + W and Ctrl + Alt + Up/Down creates a console log of the variable.</strong>. So with status we can determine what to do if the response is not the correct, beause it has some problem like incorrect name, unexisting file etc.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:08:00 to 1:30:00:</span> The headers travel before the rest of the information, they arrive first, and as we can see in the following list, headers are shared in the state 2:
                        <ul>
                            <li>0: Instance created // UNSENT. Client has been created. open() not called yet.</li>
                            <li>1: Instance setted // OPENED. open() has been called.</li>
                            <li>2: Sharing of headers between client and server // HEADERS_RECEIVED. send() has been called, and headers and status are available.</li>
                            <li>3: Transfer of information // LOADING. Downloading; responseText holds partial data.</li>
                            <li>4: End of communication (by succes or failure) // DONE. The operation is complete.</li>
                        </ul>
                    So we can set an if for state 2 to do something specific. We can see the headers in the Network/Headers, aside preview. We have the method getAllResponseHeaders, that brings all the headers in the response and getResponseHeader(), who brings the specific header we put in the parenthesis, for example: content-length or content-type: e.target.getResponseHeader('content-length'). We can save that in a variable and create a conditional to say if content-length greater than 4, do something. Meanwhile,content-type defines first the type of content (text/plain) and optionally the character codification (charset=UTF-8). This content-type is so useful. Some consufing explanation about formats, the type of content shown in the console could not be the real one, for example an image named .txt in purpose, the console will still show text/plain. Now, to verify if effectively the response is a text/plain we can use the method includes. The method includes returns true if the text selected is inside the string, for examples:
                    <ul>
                        <li>'This is a text'.includes('tex') // True</li>
                        <li>'This is a text'.includes('tax') // False</li>
                    </ul>
                    So we make a conditional if the contentType does not include text/plain we will do something, like saying the content received is not the content-type expected. The nature and format of a document are known as MIME types, according to MDN <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types" target="_blank">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types</a>, <em>a media type (also known as a Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions or MIME type) indicates the nature and format of a document, file, or assortment of bytes</em>.

                    <li><span class="hour">1:31:00 to 1:39:00:</span> In those cases where we realize the content-type is not the expected, we can cancel the request withing the addEventListener with e.target.abort(). This cancels the connection with the server. That shoots an event called 'abort', and we can set another addEventListener to do something when the connection is aborted:
                    <ul>
                        <li>xhr.addEventListener('abort', e => {console.log('abort event'); console.error('Aborted comunication');});</li>
                    </ul>
                    The state 4 will happen all the same, if the connection was a success or not.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:40:00 to 1:43:00:</span> The element xhr has a property called timeout where I can defined the maximum time (in miliseconds) for the connection to last: xhr.timeout = 100. When 100 miliseconds pass the event 'timeout' will be shoot, and we can use it for an addEventListener. For disabling it we should put the xhr.timeout value in 0: xhr.timeout = 0; that's a way to say it take the time you need. If the event timeout happens it will cut the connection. This part corresponds to the file <a href="/clase45/01-AJAX/AJAX-6/index.html" target="_blank">AJAX-6</a>.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:43:00 to 1:46:00:</span> The event load is shooted directly when state 4 happens, so instead of saying  if (e.target.readyState === 4) we can replace that for xhr.addEventListener('load', e => {if (e.target.status === 200) {console.log(e.target.responseText)} else {console.error('Communication error')}); The event 'load' only happens when the response is succesful. This part corresponds to the file <a href="/clase45/01-AJAX/AJAX-7/index.html" target="_blank">AJAX-7</a>.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:46:00 to 2:06:00:</span> This part corresponds to the file <a href="/clase45/01-AJAX/AJAX-8/index.html" target="_blank">AJAX-8</a>. In this part we're going to do a request when necessary, through a button. First we have a partials folder with an html document products.html, with the information of a product, is just the html of an article tag, with an h2, and an unordered list with list item with the information of brand, price, warranty and description, just for one product. So, first we set an addEventListener for the button:
                        <ul>
                            <li>document.querySelector('.btn-get-product').addEventListener('click', e => {}) // Inside the addEventListener for the btn event click we put the code for a request with AJAX, as follows</li>
                            <li>const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();</li>
                            <li>xhr.addEventListener('readystatechange', e => {}) // Inside the addEventListener for the event readystatechange we set the conditionals if headers received in state 2 are what we want (in this case we want to receive a 'text/html' file)</li>
                            <li>if (e.target.readyState === 2) {} // That means when readyState has a value 2 do the following:</li>
                            <li>if ( !e.target.getResponseHeader('content-type').includes('text/html')) {xhr.abort}; // This means cancel the communication if not the response header we want or in other words if the response header doesn't include 'text/html'.</li>
                        </ul>
                    If the event 'abort' happens it will shoot the following addEventListener:
                        <ul>
                            <li>xhr.addEventListener('abort', e => {console.log('abort event'); showError();}) // showError is a function created by the developer.</li>
                        </ul>
                    Also, we can define a maximum time to established the connection with the event 'timeout':
                        <ul>
                            <li>xhr.addEventListener('timeout', e => {console.log('timeout event'); showError('Maximum wait time exceeded');})</li>
                        </ul>
                    An finally we can define something for the event 'load', like putting the responseText received within our HTML file, with an .innetHTML, conditioning what will happens if an error occurs:
                    <ul>
                        <li>xhr.addEventListener('load', e => {</li>
                        <li>    console.log('Evento load');</li>
                        <li>    if (e.target.status === 200) {console.log('Status ok'); // If status OK</li>
                        <li>        productContainer.innerHTML = e.target.responseText;</li>
                        <li>    } else if (e.target.status === 404) {console.error('No encontrado'); // If status 404, that means not found.</li>
                        <li>        showError(); // showError('Recurso no encontrado');</li>
                        <li>    } else {console.error('Status incorrecto'); showError();}});</li>
                    </ul>
                    There are other status, not just 404 or 200, to see them all visit <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status" target="_blank">HTTP Status Codes in MDN</a>:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Informational responses (100 to 199).</li>
                        <li>Successful responses (200 to 299) // We can just ask for status 200 and it will be all the same.</li>
                        <li>Redirection messages (300 to 399).</li>
                        <li>Client error responses (400 to 499).</li>
                        <li>Server error responses (500 to 599).</li>
                    </ol>
                    Finally we define, optionally, the timeout: xhr.timeout = 1000; (1 second), also we define the source with xhr.open('get', 'partials/product.html'); and send the request with xhr.send(); The function showError is stablished as follows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>const showError = error => {productContainer.innerHTML = error ?? 'An error occurs';}; // the ?? is an operator called 'nulish coalescing' (in spanish <em>'fusi√≥n de null'</em>) and is a logical operator that returns its right-hand side operand when its left-hand side operand is null or undefined, and otherwise returns its left-hand side operand.</li>
                    </ul>
                    To understand better the 'nulish coalescing' operator: if we have a variable a = null if the code a ?? 2 the answer will be 2, that means if a is null return 2. Also works with several other statements, as a ?? b ?? null ?? 2 ?? undefined (will return 2, the firts one different from null or undefinded). This operator is only available in ES11 and posterior.
                    </li>

                    The problem until know is that function start() happens when we refresh (F5) the page, the idea is that it should happen when user press in the page they want to go. For that we do as follows.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:20:00 to 2:29:00:</span> For solve the problem above we set and addEventListener with the event 'hashchange': window.addEventListener('hashchange', e => {console.log('hashchange event')}), then we can put inside it the function getIdFromHash or loadAjaxFromId. Finally the <a href="/clase45/02-SPA/SPA-3/index.html" target="_blank">SPA-3</a> adds some other things to the addEventListener with the event hash.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The function start() call the function loadDefaultPage(): const start = () => {loadDefaulPage();};</li>
                        <li>The function loadDefaultPage creates the id using the function getIdFromHash() and put that id as an argument for the function loadAjaxFromId: const loadDefaultPage = () => {const id = getIdFromHash(); loadAjaxFromId(id);}</li>
                        <li>The function loadAjaxFromId charge AJAX, from the id selected, creation an url from the id, using the fuction getUrlFromId() and iniatializing AJAX with another function called initAjax() and adding the partial HTML when the event load happens, using an addEventListener: const loadAjaxFromId = id => {const url = getUrlFromId(id); const xhr = initAjax(url); xhr.addEventListener('load', e => {if (e.target.status === 200) {const partial HTML = e.target.responseText; mainElement.innerHTML = partialHTML;}});};</li>
                        <li>The function getUrlFromId is short, just returns the URL complete adding the other part of the address: const getUrlFromId = id => `partials/${id}.html`;</li>
                        <li>To load the AJAX from the id with every hashchange we use an addEvenListener for the object window: window.addEventListener('hashchange', e => {const id = getIdFromHash(); loadAjaxFromId(id);}</li>
                        <li>The function initAjax, called by loadAjaxFromId get the URL, set the mthod 'get',instances the request, opens it and sends it, returning xhr, to be used in loadAjaxFromId: const initAjax = (url, method = 'get') => {const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhr.open(method, url); xhr.send() return xhr;};</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li>Previouslly calling all the selectors descendant from .main-nav: const links = document.querySelectorAll('.main-nav a');</li>
                        <li>Then parsing the links with a for each and setting conditional to add the classList .active if the href attribute has the id #/${id} and remove if not: const SetActiveLink = id => {links.forEach(link => {if (link.getAttribute('href') === `#/${id}` {link.classList.add('active'); link.ariaCurrent = 'page';} else {link.classList-remove('active'); link.removeAttribute('aria-current');}});};</li>

                    The attribute aria-current is used as a semantic attribute for accesability, it says to the browser or accesibility tools that that is the active or current page. ARIA stands for Accessible Rich Internet Applications and specifies how to increase the accessibility of web pages, in particular, dynamic content, and user interface components developed with Ajax, HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies. This is just one of the maremagnum of specialities in Web Development.

                    <li><span class="hour">13:00 to 25:00:</span> JSON format to generates structure of data. The are other formats as CSV (comma-separated values), used for Excel. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) compites with XML (Extensible Markup Language). In XML, format .xml we invent the labels, for example the label &lt;person&gt;&lt;/person&gt; and we can create attributes for the label, everyhing made up by us. Unexpected question about linking JSON with the systema NBC (Next Byte Codes. The extension for JSON is .json and has the structured of an object. In the image below we can compared the XML format at the left and the JSON format at the right:
                    <div class="image-container"><img src="images/xml-vs-json.jpg" alt="XML vs JSON Format"></div>
                    In summary, both are forms to send data, but JSON is very similar to a JavaScript object, you can put in JSON any type of JavaScript value, except by undefined. This undefined is a value we just find in JavaScript. JSON is very useful and very used with AJAX.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">25:00 to 30:00:</span> The object JSON is part of the JavaScript interpreter in the browser. So, with dot "." we can use properties of that object, as .parse and .stringify. JSON.stringify() converts the value in a string in format JSON. This is important because when we send data from a system or device to another one through the HTTP (Hipertext Transfer Protocol) the sharing content communication form is text and binary content, but we cannot send objects, structured data as variables, arrays or functions. So, what happens is that the system receives the text in form of JSON format or XML format and translate the data into objects with live and sens.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">30:00 to 31:00:</span> When we treat an object as a text, for example put in it in an alert: alert(personObject); the way it will be shown is: [object Object]</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">32:00 to 41:00:</span> The method .parse JSON.parse() do the reverse than .stringify, that means converts the JSON format into an object. Once created the object we can check for its properties and loop over it with a forEach. Now, instead of forEach we can also use the method .join. This method use the value defined as separator of the array elements converting the array in a string. An example of the use of .join is: const fruit = ['orange', 'banana', 'mango', 'apple']; so we apply .join fruit.join('*') and it returns 'orange*banana*mango*apple'. It' useful to put label as a br between the elements of the array.</li>

                    <li><span class="hour">32:00 to 45:00:</span> Exceptions - Try/Catch. <em>An exception is an error object that has been thrown.</em> To understand better this we should know the type of errors in JavaScript. Source <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/errors-in-javascript/" target="_blank">A definitve guide to handling errors in JavaScript</a>:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Uncaught Range Error. This error occurs in Google Chrome under a few various scenarios. Another reason why this error happens is if you have passed a value that is out of a function's parameter's range.</li>
                        <li>Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property. This error occurs when you set a property on an undefined reference. For example initializing a reference without a value and try to accessing its properties.</li>
                        <li>Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property. This is one of the most frequently occurring errors in JavaScript. This error occurs when you attempt to read a property or call a function on an undefined object. An undefined object is one of the many possible causes of this error. Another prominent cause of this issue can be an improper initialization of the state while rendering the UI. The essence to avoid this here is to always initialize your variables properly before using them.</li>
                        <li>TypeError: 'undefined' is not an object. This error occurs in Safari when you try to access the properties of or call a method on an undefined object. The solution to this error is also the same ‚Äî make sure that you have initialized your variables correctly and they are not undefined when a property or method is accessed.</li>
                        <li>TypeError: null is not an object. This is, again, similar to the previous error. It occurs on Safari, and the only difference between the two errors is that this one is thrown when the object whose property or method is being accessed is null instead of undefined. Since null is a value explicitly set to a variable and not assigned automatically by JavaScript. This error can occur only if you're trying to access a variable you set null by yourself. So, you need to revisit your code and check if the logic that you wrote is correct or not.</li>
                        <li>TypeError: Cannot read property 'length'. This error occurs in Chrome when you try to read the length of a null or undefined object. The cause of this issue is similar to the previous issues, but it occurs quite frequently while handling lists; hence it deserves a special mention. However, in the newer versions of Chrome, this error is reported as Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined. The fix, again, is to ensure that the object whose length you're trying to access exists and is not set to null.</li>
                        <li>TypeError: 'undefined' is not a function. This error occurs when you try to invoke a method that doesn't exist in your script, or it does but can not be referenced in the calling context. This error usually occurs in Google Chrome, and you can solve it by checking the line of code throwing the error. If you find a typo, fix it and check if it solves your issue. If you have used the self-referencing keyword this in your code, this error might arise if this is not appropriately bound to your context. To solve this, you must pass the proper reference to the function by binding it with the bind() method.</li>
                        <li>ReferenceError: event is not defined. This error occurs when you try to access a reference not defined in the calling scope. This usually happens when handling events since they often provide you with a reference called event in the callback function. This error can occur if you forget to define the event argument in your function's parameters or misspell it. This error might not occur in Internet Explorer or Google Chrome (as IE offers a global event variable and Chrome attaches the event variable automatically to the handler), but it can occur in Firefox. So it's advisable to keep an eye out for such small mistakes.</li>
                        <li>TypeError: Assignment to constant variable. This is an error that arises out of carelessness. If you try to assign a new value to a constant variable, you'll be met with such a result. While it seems easy to fix right now, imagine hundreds of such variable declarations and one of them mistakenly defined as const instead of let! Unlike other scripting languages like PHP, there's minimal difference between the style of declaring constants and variables in JavaScript. Therefore it's advisable to check your declarations first of all when you face this error. You could also run into this error if you forget that the said reference is a constant and use it as a variable. This indicates either carelessness or a flaw in your app's logic. Make sure to check this when trying to fix this issue.</li>
                        <li>(unknown): Script error. A script error occurs when a third-party script sends an error to your browser. This error is followed by (unknown) because the third-party script belongs to a different domain than your app. The browser hides other details to prevent leaking sensitive information from the third-party script.You can not resolve this error without knowing the complete details. Here's what you can do to get more information about the error:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Add the crossorigin attribute in the script tag.</li>
                                <li>Set the correct Access-Control-Allow-Origin header on the server hosting the script.</li>
                                <li>[Optional] If you don't have access to the server hosting the script, you can consider using a proxy to relay your request to the server and back to the client with the correct headers.</li>
                            </ol>
                            Once you can access the details of the error, you can then set down to fix the issue, which will probably be with either the third-party library or the network.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    When an error is produced it throws an exception. So, it's important to catch the error to allow the JS engine to continue working and reading other parts of the code. So, we catch the exceptions using the words try and catch, like this:
                    <div class="image-container"><img src="images/try-catch-example1.jpg" alt="Try and Catch Example 1"></div>
                    If we have code inside of a try block and an error occurs the engine will go to catch en will execute the code within it. In the variable error from the catch we're going to have the details about the error., that means the object error, remember an error is an object. In catch we can set or customize a message as console.log('Ups!, something went wrong!') and execute a function as showErrorMessage(); or change the value of a variable, like i = 0; or assign an unknown value to the variable user: user = 'unknown';. After the catch we can continue reading the following code without problem, despite the error and the exceptions.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">46:00 to 51:00:</span> JavaScript errors have three properties:
                    <ol>
                        <li>message: A string value that carries the error message</li>
                        <li>name: The type of error that occurred (We'll dive deep into this in the next section)</li>
                        <li>stack: The stack trace of the code executed when the error occurred.</li>
                    </ol>
                    The idea is not to put trys and catchs all over the code, but in those places where we know errors can occur and it doesn't depend on us. Because if there are syntax errors the code won't work directly with or without try and catch.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">52:00 to 1:27:00:</span> In real life exceptions can happen if a .json file have no valid information, so when try to convert in an object with JSON.parse, that will throw an exception.

Another way to create or form an exception is with the use of a confirm, like this: if (confirm('Do you want that we call an unexisting function?') {thisFunctionIsUndefined();}. Also we can directly throw an exception: if (confirm('Do you want that we throw an exception?')) {throw new Error('This is an exception thrown by us!');}.

                    Extension for JSON viewer in Google Chrome. It's common that pages use data from other pages, using API's and web servers, for example despegar.com, the dollar price in newspaper platforms or services with weather information. There are free or payed services. API stands for Application Programming Interface. We can play a little bit by using the page <a href="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/" target="_blank">https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/</a>. We can take the post array and parse it with a forEach, like this:
                    <ul>
                        <li>posts.forEach(post => {console.warn('Datos del posteo con id #' + post.id);</li>
                    </ul>

                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:36:00 to 2:46:00</span> Calling any post using an input. First we have the following HTML:
                    <div class="image-container"><img src="images/ajax-json-html-input.jpg" alt="AJAX-JSON HTML and input"></div>
                    The button 'getPost' is disabled by default in the HTML. So, explanation about how to assign the property disabled to the boolean value of a condition:
                    <ul>
                        <li>inputPostId.addEventListener('input', e => {btnGetPost.disabled = !(inputPostId.value && inputPostId.value !== '0');
                        }); // That mean when event 'input' happens the property disabled of the button btnGetPost will be assigned with the opposite boolean value of the following condition: if there is content and (&&) the content is different for the string '0', then transform the result in the opposite.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:46:00 to 2:58:00:</span> Tha input has min="1" max="100", that means can have the value 0 or 101, but we can write directly 0 or 400. But when it has value 0 the btnGetPost is disabled because of the event 'input' programming. We also need to disable this button when click, like this:
                    <ul>
                        <li>btnGetPost.addEventListener('click', eventClick => {eventClick.target.disabled = true;};</li>
                    </ul>
                    Now to get the post clicking the button we need also to add the following steps within the btnGetPost.addEventListener:
                    <ol>
                        <li>const postId = inputPostId.value // We store the value of the input in the const postId</li>
                        <li>cost urlPost = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/' + postId // We add the value received and stored in the variable postId to the string url, and assign that value to the variable urlPost</li>
                        <li>const postReq = ajaxInit(urlPost) // In the const postReq we assign the value returned by the function ajaxInit, giving it as argument the urlPost value. The function ajaxInit is declared outside the event for the button, and what it does is to create the new request using XMLHttpRequest, like this:
                            <ul>
                                <li>const ajaxInit = (url, method = 'get') => {const req = new XMLHttpRequest; req.open(method, url); req.send(); return req;}</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>postReq.addEventListener ('load', eventProgress => {} // This means, for the object returned by the fuction ajaxInit (req), we set the addEventListener for the event 'load' and within this listener we set the following conditionals:</li>
                        <li>if (eventProgress.target.status === 200) {const contentType = eventProgress.target.getResponseHeader('content-type'); if (contentType.includes('application/json')) // That means if the status of the request is 200 we create and store the header 'content-type' in a variable and ask if that content-type includes or is the content type 'application/json', then we safe the response in the json format in a variable jsonResponse, as it follows:</li>
                        <li>const jsonResponse = eventProgress.target.responseText; try {const post = JSON.parse(jsonResponse); fillArticleFromPost(post); // We set a try and parse inside the jsonResponse and store the post object obteined from it in the variable post, then we call the function fillArticleFromPost, adding the post obteined as argument. The function fillArticleFromPost does as follows:
                            <ul>
                                <li>const fillArticleFromPost = post => {articlePost.classList.add('block-visible'); articlePostTitle.innerHTML = post.title; articlePostBody.innerHTML = post.body;articlePostUserId.innerHTML = post.userId;}; // This function add the class 'block.visible' to the HTML element articlePost ( In CSS the articlePost has display: none by default), receives the object post as an argument and add sthe properties of the object in the HTML values of the element articlePost.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>} catch (error) {console.error('Error in the convertion'); console.log('Message:\n', error.message); console.log('Stack:\n', error.stack);} // In the catch we capture any error object that could be throw if the jsonResponse can't be parse by the method JSON.parse</li>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    </li>

                    <li><span class="hour">1:01:00 to 1:19:00:</span> Bracket notation for objects properties: object['property']; that way we can iterate the properties of an object using a for or a for in:
                        <ul>
                            <li>for (let i = 1; i < 7; i++) {console.log(obj['child' + i]);}</li>
                            <li>for (const property in character) {const listItem = document.querySelector('.character__list-description--' + property); // console.log(listItem); if (listItem) {listItem.innerHTML = character[property];}// console.log(character[property]);// console.log(`character['${property}']:`, character[property]);}</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:19:00 to 1:43:00:</span> To put the information in HTML see the example at <a href="clase48/01-AJAX-JSON/AJAX-JSON-9/index.html" target="_blank"> Class - 48: AJAX-JSON -9</a>. First we call the HTML element with querySelector using the class plus the property (same as the object's property). Juan uses an if(listItem) to make a condition for the execution of the code, so if the lisItem exist it should charge the character, but if not, nothing happens. Otherwise the code will be broken. Also in the line 39 of the JS File of <a href="clase48/01-AJAX-JSON/AJAX-JSON-9/index.html" target="_blank"> Class - 48: AJAX-JSON -9</a> Juan uses the builder function new Character(JSON.parse(characterJSON)); this creates a new Character in order instead of work with a generic one. To load the image of the character we have to set the text for the URL changing the source or src property. Before, Juan explains <strong>how to change the color of an image in a svg format: he locates the label style with the class .st0{fill:#134563;}, as we can see in the following image:</strong>
                    <div class="image-container"><img src="images/svg-charge-color.jpg" alt="Change color in a SGV format image"></div>
                    So, to change the source Juan uses the function loadImage. That function basically uses a short circuit operator to set src and alt, like this:
                        <ul>
                            <li>img.src = character.image || 'img/avatar.svg'; // This means the image of the character OR the default image, if there the character has no image.</li>
                            <li>img.alt = character.name || 'Character without picture'; // This means the name of the character OR the phrase 'Character without picture', if the character has no name.</li>
                        </ul>
                    Shortcut Ctrl + Click  to navigate between objects and elements of a .js file in VS Code. We can also use an if:
                        <ul>
                            <li>const receivedData = (character.image && character.name);</li>
                            <li>if (receivedData) {img.src = character.image; img.alt = character.name;} else {img.src = 'img/avatar.svg'; img.alt = 'Character without picture';} // This is recommended in this case because will load the precise data for any character, image and name at the same time.</li>
                        </ul>
                    Or, we can also use a ternary:
                        <ul>
                            <li>img.src = character.image ? character.image: 'img/avatar.svg'; // This means if character.image is true (or if it exists), we assign its value to img.src (the left part of the question mark) else if it is false we assign the default value (the right part of the question mark).</li>
                            <li>img.alt = character.image ? character.name: 'Character without picture';</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:44:00 to 1:54:00:</span> Deeper explanation about short circuit operator.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:54:00 to 1:58:00:</span> There are some properties of the object with more information inside, for example location and origin, so we also need to go over them, this is something Juan didn't explain at the end. Moreover, to show the characters episodes as a list we need to use the method .join to attach all the elements in an array, creating just one string, like this:
                    <dl>
                        <dt>Use of .join method</dt>
                        <dd>
                            <ul>
                                <li>const colors = ['yellow', 'orange', 'green', 'white', 'blue sky', 'red'];</li>
                                <li>color.join('@'): ['yellow@orange@green@white@blue sky@red'];</li>
                                <li>color.join('  '): ['yellow  orange  green  white  blue sky  red'];</li>
                                <li>color.join('/'): ['yellow/orange/green/white/blue sky/red'];</li>
                                <li>color.join('-'): ['yellow-orange-green-white-blue sky-red'];</li>
                                <li>color.join(', '): ['yellow, orange, green, white, blue sky, red'];</li>
                                <li>color.join(', '): ['yellow, orange, green, white, blue sky, red'];</li>
                                <li>color.join('&lt;br&gt;'): ['yellow&lt;br&gt;orange&lt;br&gt;green&lt;br&gt;white&lt;br&gt;blue sky&lt;br&gt;red'];</li>
                                <li>color.join(): ['yellow,orange,green,white,bluesky,red']; // if join has no argument put a comma between all the elements.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </dd>
                    </dl>
                    So, in the example of <a href="/clase48/01-AJAX-JSON/AJAX-JSON-9/index.html">Class - 48: AJAX-JSON - 9</a> line 63 .join is used to separte the long array of episodes into one string separated by br:
                    <ul>
                        <li>character.episode = character.episode.join('&lt;br&gt;');</li>
                    </ul> 
                    If we don't do that and use it as an array without br it will be shown horizontally and will overflow the container. Juan exaplain the CSS properties overflow: hidden; and tel-overflow: ellipsis. This last one shows three points (an ellipsis) and the end when the text overflows.

                    <li><span class="hour">1:58:00 to 2:13:00:</span> JavaScript Strict Mode. According to MDN <em>"JavaScript's strict mode is a way to opt in to a restricted variant of JavaScript, thereby implicitly opting-out of "sloppy mode". Strict mode isn't just a subset: it intentionally has different semantics from normal code. Browsers not supporting strict mode will run strict mode code with different behavior from browsers that do, so don't rely on strict mode without feature-testing for support for the relevant aspects of strict mode. Strict mode code and non-strict mode code can coexist, so scripts can opt into strict mode incrementally Strict mode makes several changes to normal JavaScript semantics":
                        <ul>
                            <li>Eliminates some JavaScript silent errors by changing them to throw errors.</li>
                            <li>Fixes mistakes that make it difficult for JavaScript engines to perform optimizations: strict mode code can sometimes be made to run faster than identical code that's not strict mode.</li>
                            <li>Prohibits some syntax likely to be defined in future versions of ECMAScript.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </em>
                    JavaScript Strict Mode was added in ECMAScript 5 in 2009. To define it we set the string 'use strict' in the .js file, inside a script label or within the scope of a function.
                    <ul>
                        <li>With Strict Mode we can not assign variables without using the key words var, let or const.</li>
                        <li>With Strict Mode when assigning a value to a primitive value, as undefined = 3; it will throw a TypeError object. // this is also not possible in sloopy mode, but in strict mode throws an error.</li>
                        <li>With Strict Mode when creating a property to a boolean value, as true.a = 3; it will throw a TypeError object. /// this is also not possible in sloopy mode, but in strict mode throws an error.</li>
                        <li>Some words as public is reserved in Stric Mode, so we can't create a variable with that word. Other reserved words are while, for, this etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:14:00 to 2:34:00:</span> No nested AJAX: To understand the concept of nested AJAX firt we have an example of a no nested AJAX code, this is how we are working.

                    Long and innecessary explanation about delay of request in JavaScript, if we need to receive the responses in the specific order what we do is to order the request 1 to call the request 2 when the response 1 is received, and then order the request 2 to call the request 3 when response 2 is received, an so on. <strong>This logic can be used to make the fibonacci secuence with JavaScript</strong>. JavaScripts works with just one execution thread, so when is busy can't do something else, is like a very basic guy.

                    The problem with this style of coding is that it creates the known and famous Pyramid of Doom or Hell of Callbacks. This will allow us to receive the responses in order and to have a more sequential code, but Callback hells can be difficult to read. So to enhace this or to solve this we use promises.

A Promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It allows you to associate handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future."</em> Promises can have the following states:
                    <em>
                        <ul>
                            <li>pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.</li>
                            <li>fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.</li>
                            <li>rejected: meaning that the operation failed.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </em>
                    <strong>An example of a promise in JavaScript is when we purchase something in a fast food restaurant and the restaurant gives us a black disc or a card with a sensor that notifies when the order is ready. So the disc is the promise that you will receive or maybe not your food ordered</strong>. Some abstract and not to effective examples to understand promises. If we don't use AJAX or asynchronous code the use of promises has no purpose. <strong>To execute something when the promise is fullfilled we use the method of promises .then().</strong> To create a promise we use the operator new and set the Callbacks resolve and reject:
                    <ul>
                        <li>const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {}); // the Callbacks resolve and reject are standard ways to call those Callbacks.</li>
                    </ul>
                    So what Juan does is to put the new promise within the function getPostPromise() and to return the new Promise((resolve, reject) =>{}); that means the result of the promise. We can set different rejects and resolves within the function, but inside the Callback resolve() we have to put the object that we want to put in the method .then. For the example is the post: resolve(post);. Next example of the use of then to receive sequential responses and make differente requests without creating a Pyramid of Doom:
                    <div class="image-container"><img src="images/use-of-then-example.jpg" alt="Example of using of method .then"></div>
                    We put a .catch at the end of the code if something is wrong: .catch(error) => {console.log(error);}. Hence any possible error when calling the promises will be catched. It will work as a try/catch statement. A brief summary and some announcements about the next class topic, basically the use of async/await syntax. Promises came with ECMAScript 6, it solved the Pyramid of Doom problem, but it's a little bit complex though, so some years later it was added the async/await syntax.

Later we're going to be working with handlebar, a JavaScript library used to create reusable webpage templates, eval is not recommended. When working with SPA autofocus doesn't work, because HTML autofocus works when the page is refreshed, so we have to programm with JavaScript for determining an element to be focused when th event 'load' occurs. The question mark separates the URL in the left part to the query parameters (specific parameters to search) in the right part. A trick used with JavaScript when working with SPA is to use conditionals if for the existence of a variable before look for it, to avoid throwing an exception, another trick is to write the variableName?.querySelector, the question mark in this case is an optional chaining operator that asks if the left part of it is not null, the execute the rest of the code. Another trick is to ask for something in the top of the page, like a class in body or in main. Juan recommends to use the debugger to solve the question mark question for tha alta.html page. Now to the question how to upload the characters to solve the <a href="/clase46/Ejercicio-AJAX-JSON-2/index.html" target="_blank">Class 46 - Exercise AJAX-JSON 2</a>, the following is the code used by Jos√© Luis to upload the characters and itereate the characterArray:
                    <div class="image-container"><img src="images/uploading-characters-from-rick-and-morty-api.jpg" alt="Uploading characters from Rick and Morty API"></div>
                    Juan recommends to use an option list instead of a select for cases like these, but we have to check if the API allows to search for texts and names and not just through ids.

                    <li><span class="hour">28:00 to 47:00:</span> A summary about <a href="clase49/01-AJAX-binario/AJAX-binario-2/index.html" target="_blank"> Class - 49: Binary AJAX 2.</a> overall about promises. Regularly in the promises we have asynchronous code. The methods resolve() or reject() will be executed in the different parts of the asynchronous code where we need it. The promises must be returned. The use of .then and catch is a for to work with promises.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">48:00 to 1:27:00:</span> Async/await syntax, according to MDN <em>"The async function declaration declares an async function where the await keyword is permitted within the function body. The async and await keywords enable asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style, avoiding the need to explicitly configure promise chains."</em> We are working with the file <a href="clase48/05-AJAX-anidado/AJAX-anidado-2/index.html" target="_blank"> Class - 48: AJAX nested 2.</a> The following is an example of the use of async and await:
                    <div class="image-container"><img src="images/async-await-example.jpg" alt="async/await example"></div>
                    The keyword 'await' is used to put the promise's response in the variable determined, for example:
                    <ul>
                        <li>let response = await getPostPromise(1); // Whatever the response is (what we set in the resolve), when the promise is resolved, await will assign it to variable let response.</li>
                    </ul>
                    The keyword 'await' is only valid in async functions. So, function using 'await' have to be determined as async, like this:
                    <ul>
                        <li>async function getPostsPromiseAsyncAwait() {console.log('Start of requests'); let response = await getPostPromise(1); console.log('End of requests');} // If we don't use the word wait the variable response will have the promise, probably with the status "pending", not the response.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Therefore, when we use await the JavaScript engine literally awaits within the function for the promise to be solved, but the engine keeps reading the following code outside the function. When the function is async works as any other function, but allows us to use the term await within it. When we have to many awaits and with one response we call the next one, we can use a for, inside a try, like this:
                    <div class="image-container"><img src="images/for-iteration-promises-await.png" alt="Iteration async/await function using a for operator"></div>
                    Finally a fictional example:
                    <ul>
                        <li>async function getPostsPromiseAsyncAwait() {</li>
                        <li>const id = 100;</li>
                        <li>const persona = await getPersona(id);</li>
                        <li>const cursos = await getCursos(persona.dni);</li>
                        <li>cursos[0].confirmado = true;</li>
                        <li>cursos[1].confirmado = false;</li>
                        <li>const respuesta = await confirmarCursos(cursos);</li>
                        <li>console.log(respuesta);}</li>
                    </ul>

                    <li><span class="hour">1:27:00 to 1:31:00:</span><strong>AJAX summary. AJAX is asynchronous communication, we can do it by XMLHttpRequest or by fetch that uses promises. Generally we don't create promises from zero, what professionals do is to use already existin functions or libraries that has promises incorporated. Promises give us an object that represents an operation with a unknown result, and that result can be resolved or reject. For promises, if we don't use async/await we have to use, instead, the methods .then and catch. The mnethod then obtains the resolve from the promise and catch receives the error. Meanwhile, with async/await we put the term await before the promises, being the result of a function or not and await for the result not the promise itself. When we get the result from the promise we can call the next one, even using a for. Asynchronous code is not always used to access to remote resources, we can also use it for local resources. Some browser API's can allow us to work with promises. For example the reading of fisical files can be done through promises. That means we ask the browser to read a file and meanwhile we can be doing something else in our code. Another example is when we want to access to the webcam or to some other devices, they can also work using promises.</strong></li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:31:00 to 1:58:00:</span> Binary AJAX. The picture and image file are binary files. If we open an image with notepad it will show an unreadable text. That binary content can be received by AJAX. This is useful to set for example the loading percentage or loading time. For this the tutor uses the fuction loadImg(), this function has three arguments: the URL, the alt and the class or selector where we want to put the image. To work with images and AJAX we have to define in the const ajaxInit function the argument responseType and assign it the value 'blob'. The value 'blob' means Binary Large Object. When this value is set we can't read the response with a e.target.resposeText because it will show a DOMException. But we can access with .response and that creates an object, representing the image, in console it appears like: response: Blob {size: 52637, type: 'image/jpeg')}. Juan stores that e.target.response in the const blobImage. At this point the browser undestand the content is binary but it's not like a jpg image that we can use as we were in Windows. Once we have the binary object we can use the method URL.createObjectURL(), this method creates an URL for Blob objects. The method URL.createObjectURL() returns an special URL that Juan stores in a const blobURL, like this: const blobUrl = URL.createObjectURL(blobImage); this URL is shown in th console as blob:http:/127.0.0.1:5500/61dbbbee-fe44-4e94-98c7-3d53d970c3d5, that URL is stored in the browser while the LiveServe tab is open and is a temporary URL, when we refresh it will change. Finally, after creating a new img element with createElement we define the blobUrl as src, the function's argument alt as the property alt and the target selector. We can set an if for targetElement to apply the method appendChild(newImg), just when targetElement exists, or using the optional chaining operator (question mark), that asks if left is not null or undefined, then it applies the code in the right.

So, to the question, how hackers do to hack servers the Juan example is the following: <em>"There are 1000 different ways to attack, SQL injection is one of them, where depending on the way of work in the server the hacker arrange a string for modifying the query inside the server. That will be possible if the web page server didn't take any measure. In serious escenarios the code line could, instead of getting data, creating a new text file, and that text file can be code in different languages or formats. If the hacker manage to get the file into a public access folder he will be able to access with a URL like http://somewebsite.com/myrecentlycreatedfolder.php and execute the code inside the server.

                    Then we apply event's delegation using conditionals if e.target has or contains the classList btn-show-picture (e.target.classList.contains('btn-show-picture')). The same way we can asks for the dataset of the button using e.target.dataset, as we know the data attributes became properties of the element, so it allows us to set them in variables const that we use as arguments for the function loadImg(imgUrl, imgAlt, imgTarget);

                    Example of object destructuring assignment, for mor information <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment" target="_blank">Destructuring assignment</a>:

                        <li>const {imgUrl:a, imgAlt: b, imgTarget: c} = e.target.dataset; // The colons rename the variable. This is the same as the following:</li>
                        <li>const a = e.target.dataset.imgUrl;</li>
                        <li>const a = e.target.dataset.imgAlt;</li>
                        <li>const a = e.target.dataset.imgTarget;</li>
                    </ul>
                    We can also apply arry's values to different variables like this:
                    <ul>
                        <li>let a, b, rest;</li>
                        <li>[a, b] = [10, 20] // 10 is assigned to a and 20 to b</li>
                        <li>[a, b, ...rest] = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];</li>
                    </ul>
                    Some questions and doubts. The main thing about using binary AJAX for images is to program diferent interactive things that can happen when the image in loading, for example. For example applying classes for movement or a percentage bar when loading. To see an example about it see the file <a href="clase50/02-AJAX-binario/AJAX-binario-3/index.html" target="_blank"> Class - 50: Binary AJAX 3.</a> 
                    <li><span class="hour">2:09:00 to 2:25:00:</span> The function loadImg(), as we said before, use three parameters: const loadImg = (url, alt, targetSelector) =>{}. It uses a conditional to avoid errors, saying that if there is no targetSelector assigned to the const targetElement return null and no error will happen. Then the function adds the classList to the 'loading' to targetElement
                        <div class="image-container"><img src="images/function-loadImg-ajax.jpg" alt="Function loadImg using binary AJAX"></div>
                    Now the progress element has two properties max and value, if we do not set a value it is undetermined so it will change like knight rider lights, zero is empty and the max value is full. With a label element we can associate the progress indicating, for example that it is at 50%, like this:
                    <ul>
                        <li>&lt;progress max="220" value="110" id="progress"&gt;&lt;/progress&gt;</li>
                        <li>&lt;label for="progress"&gt;50%&lt;/label&gt;</li>
                    </ul>
                    Very cleverly, Juan creates a function to get a random id for the label and progress element, so we don't have any problems with any other similar id in other elements, like this:
                    <ul>
                        <li>const getRandomId = prefix => prefix + Math.round(Math.random() * 1000000000);</li>
                    </ul>
                    The id randomly created is put in the variable progressId and we put that variable as argument of the function getProgressElement(progressId); and the function getLabelElement(progressId); like this:
                    <ul>
                        <li>const progressId = getRandomId('progress-load-img-');</li>
                        <li>const progress = getProgressElement(progressId);</li>
                        <li>const label = getLabelElement(progressId);</li>
                    </ul>
                    Then we put the progress and label within the element targetElement, like this:
                    <ul>
                        <li>targetElement.appendChild(progress);</li>
                        <li>targetElement.appendChild(label);</li>
                    </ul>
                    Now, inside the ajaxInit function we set that when image load req.addEventListener('load', e => {if (e.target.estatus === 200){const blobImage = e.target.response; const blobUrl = URL.createObjectURL(blobImage); const newImg = getImageElement(blobUrl, alt); targetElement.appendChild(newImg);}}) we set the methods progress.remove and label.remove to delete the elements in the HTML. Additionally, we have a code for the req element to react to the 'progress' event indicating, the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>req.addEventListener('progress', e => {if (e.lengthComputable) {we create a const percentage = Math.round(e.loaded * 100/ e.total); and we assign it to progress.value = percentage; label.innerHTML = percentage + '%';}}) // event progress happens progressivaly, so if we create a console.log we will the result several times.

                    </ul>
                    For doing the image to start small we define in the CSS the images with class .loading the property max-height: 0; and the images with the class .tour a transition: 1.3s; the pseudoclass :is helps to use less code:
                    <ul>
                        <li>.tour :is(button:hover, button:focus) {background-color: #c1121f; color: #f8f8f8;} // This mean within .tour the elements with the condition button:hover and button:focus will have the styles defined, it is the same but shorter than next:</li>
                        <li>.tour button:hover, .tour button:focus {background-color: #c1121f; color: #f8f8f8;}</li>

We'll barely create promises by our self, usually we'll use functions, interfaces or libraries that use and return promises. So, we can use an await to wait the result (resolve or reject), we can store the promise in an object and use .then to do something when resolve or a catch to do something when error. Fetch is just a function. According to MDN <em>the Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources (including across the network). It will seem familiar to anyone who has used XMLHttpRequest, but the new API provides a more powerful and flexible feature set.</em> After initializing the XMLHttpRequest, as the follows:
                    <div class="container"><img src="images/initializing-xmlhttprequest.jpg" alt="Initializing XMLHttpRequest"></div>
                    We use promises and manage the response with .then:
                    <div class="container"><img src="images/fetch-with-then-catch.jpg" alt="Fetch with the methods .then and catch"></div>
                    Or with async/await.
                    <div class="container"><img src="images/fetch-with-aync-await.jpg" alt="Fetch with async/await"></div>
                    The function Fetch has the promises incorporated it like within it has coded new Promise..., so fetch returns a new promise when we create it. const promise = fetch(url + id);

                    <li><span class="hour">11:00 to 48:00:</span> Introduction to backend and Node.js. A litle bit about PHP, is a multipurpose language, but it's usually applied in the backend. Node.js appears to use JavaScript in different environments, not just the browser. The JavaScript engine V8 for Chrome represented at its time a revolution in browsers and internet. Some important links:
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://v8.dev/" target="_blank">https://v8.dev/</a> // JavaScript engine page. Node.js has within the V8 engine. Node.js is a JavaScript environment build with V8.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://nodejs.org/es/" target="_blank">https://nodejs.org/es/</a> // Node.js official page</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.electronjs.org/" target="_blank">https://www.electronjs.org/</a> // To build desktop applications as WhatsApp, Slack, Discord and VS Code</li>
                        <li><a href="https://nodered.org/" target="_blank">https://nodered.org/</a> // To programm devices connected to the internet, as in IoT (Internet of Things), for example a Vacuum cleaner bot</li>
                    </ul>
                    In general PHP is a server language that works with MariaDB (Relational database system), SQL, and the apache server, or a setted environment. Another language used in backend is java, that can work with SQL server and Oracle. Other languages are python and .Net. A server can be the hardware where we install the program that provides the features we need for server purposes. In software development a server is just a program. We communicate with server throughout requests and it response, resolving or rejecting our request. There are different kind of servers:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Database servers // Build to response to clients for databases.</li>
                        <li>Website servers // Used for website clients, that means browsers. </li>
                        <li>File servers (FTP) servers // Used for file and folder clients, like filezilla.</li>
                        <li>Gaming servers // Used to connect with gaming clients, as Counter Strike, Call of Duty, FIFA.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Any server accomplish an specific purpose depending on the client the are build for. In web development, when we connect with some resource it should be a server for the request to be respond. There are different kinds of webserver:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Apache // Very popular and known. Almost always used with PHP, MySQL and Linux.</li>
                        <li>Internet Information Services // Microsoft's server.</li>
                        <li>Nginx // Also widely used.</li>
                    </ul>
                    In general the web servers use one programming language. Examples of languages used in servers are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>PHP</li>
                        <li>Java</li>
                        <li>SQL</li>
                        <li>Python</li>
                        <li>.Net</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">48:00 to 56:00:</span> Node.js installation. Explanation about semantic versioning: Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
                    <ul>
                        <li>MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes</li>
                        <li>MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner</li>
                        <li>PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes</li>
                    </ul>
                    Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format. For more information check <a href="https://semver.org/" target="_blank">https://semver.org/</a>. FOr example La √∫ltima versi√≥n con LTS long term support es 18.12.1 LTS18 (Versi√≥n mayor, se modifica cuando las modificaciones generaron alguna incompatibilidad con algo). 12 (Versi√≥n menor, se cambia cuando se agreg√≥ una nueva caracter√≠stica). 1 (parche, cuando se hace una correcci√≥n). The version LTS offers a Long Term Support (30 months).

                    Now, if we have a folder with a index.js file we can open it in the terminal from Windows using right click/Copy as path and paste in the terminal using the command cd. For example: cd "C:\Users\Dario Ernesto\Downloads\New folder". Or directly right click/Open in Terminal. Once inside we can write node index.js and run the file. That will show us the console.log('Hello universe'). With Node.js we can program the action of create a set of folder with .txt files with some text inside from a list of names (array), using a for. Also, we can create applications with tools as electron. But, the most common use of Node.js is as a server. That way Node.js allow us to work in the Backend and FrontEnd just by knowing JavaScript.

When working with Node.js we can have libraries inside different libraries and subgroups of libraries, and functions and methods. With npm we can manage this in an eadier way, traversing the dependency trees of each library. This is installed by default when we download and install Node.js. Other management automation software are Yarn, Chocolatley. The following are some important commands for npm:

                    <strong>In package.json "main": index.js is the entry point.</strong> Any file name typed in there will be executed when we write in the Terminal "node .". If there is another .js it will run the first one. In package.json we can set the author and the license type "MIT" or "ISC". Now, libraries as express are available in the website <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_blank">https://www.npmjs.com/</a>. In the package.json we will put in "name", such of the library, in that case will be "express", and the keywords found in npm website for that library. Express has 22.2 million downloads weekly. Also we have a description for express in npm website and it shows us that it has 31 dependencies. To use express we have to code the following:

                            <li>In the Terminal we can run the script by typing npm run test // This shows the script content. We can especify some tasks to run for the test.

                            <li>"scripts": { "show-node-version": "node -v"}, // This is an example invented by us. When type in the Terminal npm run show-node-version it will whow v18.12.1</li>
                            <li>npm run start // Also works without run: npm start. Any other need the keyword run, for example npm run get-info, npm run watch-sass</li>
                            <li>"scripts": { "get-info": "echo %npm_package_name%"}, // The word echo print in the console and the % marks area identificators, as a variable, with this node will understand and show the folder name: 03-scripts.</li>
                            <li>"scripts": { "get-info": "echo %npm_package_name% v: %npm:package_version%"}, // This will print the name and the version of the project: 03-scripts v: 1.0.0</li>
                        </ul>
                    The npm documentation tells us what names we can acces typing npm_package_property-name, because e.g: %npm_package_description% does not work to show us the description info in the Terminal.
                    <li><span class="hour">1:55:00 to 2:10:00:</span> Create a server with Node.js. In Node.js website we can find the documentation and within we can find references to the Node.js modules. They are already installed when we installed Node.js. The most interesting for us in, at this momment HTTP, but there are other like Crypto and many others. So, if we access to the link or HTTP module in Node.js webpage we will find a lot of information about it. As we said this module is installed together with Node.js package. To see the link about Node.js documentation: <a href="https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v18.x/docs/api/" target="_blank">https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v18.x/docs/api/</a> and especially for HTTP module: <a href="https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v18.x/docs/api/http.html">https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v18.x/docs/api/http.html</a>. To create the server we type the following code:
                        <div class="image-container"><img src="images/nodejs-server1.jpg" alt="Creating a server with Node.js"></div>
                    We initialize with const http = require('http'); then set the callback inside the .createServer method with the arguments request and response, set the status, set the header and the response with res.writeHead(status, headers), res.write('We can put here parts of the response') and res.end('Response's body'). The method res.end gives an end to the response. Also, we have to set the port number the server will be listening. The port number can goes from 0 to 65535, that means 65536 different port numbers. The low port numbers like 21, 22, 80, 443 are standard number for specific functions or utilities. Other bigger port number are not available to use, like 2200, 22005. Let's remember a server is a software installed in some device. In a same device we can have several servers installed, for example a web server, a fs server and a ftp server. From the outside the request will achieve the device, so the way we have to link the request to the specific server is using a determined port number. Usually, when developing, we use the port 8080, as we can see in the image and we stablish with the method .listen what to do when the connection is succeded or what to do if event 'error' happens with method .on <strong>(In Node.js the method .on is equivalent to addEventListener for events when working with JavaScript in the browser).</strong> If 8080 is in use, we can chage for 8081, 8082, 8083 and so on. The number port number 3000 is also quite used. But this not a standard, is just a habit from Node.js programmers. We create a const in uppercase to indicate in something that won't be modify or won't never change in the project. When we have this code setted and type in the Terminal node ., it will show in the console HTTP Server listening in the port 8080.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">2:10:00 to 2:22:00:</span> Now that we have the web server, we're going to need to create a web client. To do that we access in the browser to the address bar and type: http://127.0.0.1:8080 (ttp://127.0.0.1 refers to our equipment. Now, for not type node . everytime we made a change in the server code, we can use nodemon. This works like a LiveServer. Nodemon is a library, stands for Node Monitor. The node.js website saids that for install nodemon we have to type in the terminal npm i nodemon, but this command installs nodemon in the folder project. So, the recommended action is to install nodemon globally with the command npm i nodemon -g (g stands for global), this install nodemon in the equipment. Then we can just type nodemon . and this will let the Terminal and it will be stay watching.</li>

The words req and res are use as conventions, but their just names, they can be called differently. Explanation about the methods res.writeHead, res.write and res.end.

                    <li><span class="hour">2:37:00 to 2:38:00:</span> Search about the argument req and req.url and what to do when the response is 200 or 404 and use conditional if to react when the url is /product or /services or /somethingelse. Question about the use of resources from Node.js, it doesn't consume a lot of resources, later we're going to see the differences with other server as Apache, because, due to Node.js works with just one thread is highly efficient.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><span class="hour">00:00 to 06:00:</span> Comments about the object req and the method req.URL.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">07:00 to 14:00:</span> Solving the problem with nodemon. In the link of Microsoft Learn we copy the command Get-ExecutionPolicy -List and it will show us in the Terminal that ExecutionPolicy for CurrentUser is setted us Undefined, so to apply a RemoteSigned and allow us to run scripts we need to type the command Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser and this will let us run nodemon freely and without restrictions.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">14:00 to 30:00:</span>Summary about the creation of a server with Node.js. Question about the status 200 and 404, we can set the number we want for the response, but, if we set the corret one the browser can react properly to it. With the status numbers we can say to the browser what is happening and this is valuable information. Additional summary about the methods res.write and res.end.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">31:00 to 34:00:</span> An example of a response arrival in a slow connection, using setTimeout.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">34:00 to 57:00:</span> Object req. We can see the req object typing a console.log(req) inside the http.createServer callback. It's an extended object with a lot of properties. One of these is URL: req.url. If we type console.log(req.url), it will show us in the Terminal the URL, in this case just a backslash ("/") and /favicon.ico, because the browser is also searching a favicon. Now, if we don't program with conditional what to do if the user asks for one specific direction the server will always send the same information we set in the methos res.writeHead(), res.write(), res.end(). So, we need to use an if. Like this:
                        <ul>
                            <li>if (req.url === '/es.html') {res.end(`&lt;h1&gt;Hola!&lt;/h1&gt;`)} else {res.end(`&lt;h1&gt;Hello!&lt;/h1&gt;`)} </li>
                        </ul>
                    In req we also gave the property .method. When we configure a server we stablish what to responde when some url and some method is requested. We can assign the properties .method and .url to the variables method and url in two ways:
                    <div>
                        <dl>
                            <dt>Fist, by using the traditional declaration form:</dt>
                            <dd>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>const method = req.method;</li>
                                    <li>const url = req.url;</li>
                                </ul>
                            </dd>
                        </dl>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <dl>
                            <dt>Second, by using a multiple variables declaration form:</dt>
                            <dd>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>const {method, url} = req;</li>
                                </ul>
                            </dd>
                        </dl>
                    </div>
                    The most used methods are: GET (obtains), POST (upload), PUT (change), PATCH (partially change), DELETE (erase). They are semactic methods to access to web resources. Then Juan shown an example about the inadecuate use of status 200 for succes of 404 for error. He shows how the browser act when is receiving them.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">57:00 to 1:04:00:</span> Another example using the res.write to put a nav, creating a const nav with the HTML within in for of a string. Now he sets an if for each nav link: /, /reset, /product, /services. This is not a normal way to work, for this we use express. We can also work with partial HTML files and handlebars. Some comments about magic numbers.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:04:00 to 1:16:00:</span> Exercise about creating a HTTP server with Node.js for responding to different addresses. Exercise solving <a href="/clase52/02-Servidor-HTTP-ejercicio/server.js">Class 52 - Server HTTP Exercise.</a> Some questions about nodemon.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:17:00 to 1:24:00:</span> An example about responding different for the same URL but usign a different method GET or POST using a form. See the example in js file: <a href="clase52/01-Servidor-HTTP/Servidor-HTTP-8/server.js" target="_blank"> Class - 52: HTTP Server 8</a></li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:24:00 to 1:26:00:</span> Downloading and installing postman. <a href="https://www.postman.com/" target="_blank">https://www.postman.com/</a></li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:26:00 to 1:31:00:</span> Uncomfortable situation about the postman setting-up.</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:32:00 to 1:57:00:</span> Postman is a software used to connect with different web resources without using a browser. Postman is a development and testing tool. With postman we can make real requests to Node.js servers and servers in general. In postman collections are like folders, we cn change their names and use them as folders, adding requests. In the requests we can set a URL with a method, selecting from the different existing methods in JavaScript. Then postman shows us the responses sent by the server. We can duplicate the requests and save the changes. The response can be shown pretty, raw, preview, visualize, HTML. We can see the body, cookies, the headers and the test results.
                    <div class="image-container"><img src="images/postman-screenshot-example.jpg" alt="Postman screenshot example"></div>
                    In Postman each method has a different color. We can set different responses for each method and test the response with postman. <strong>Before duplicate be aware to save the changes</strong>. The status 405 determines that the method used is not correct. This status has the property 'allow', where we can set in the res.writeHead the methods allowed for determined URL, like this: res.writeHead(405, {'content-type': 'text/html; charset=utf-8', 'allow': 'GET, POST'});
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:57:00 to 2:02:00:</span> Examples of use of method DELETE and PUT. we set the url we want to DELETE and if the server is programmed it will delete the information requested. With PUT we set the type of information we want to replace, in postman, clicking Body we can choose the type of file, clickig raw we will have options like Text, JavaScript, JSON, HTML and XML. This is what is called a RESTful API, that means an interface that two computer systems use to exchange information securely over the internet. Most business applications have to communicate with other internal and third-party applications to perform various tasks. An example is <a href="http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/" target="_blank">jsonplaceholder.typicode.com</a>.</li>

                    <li><span class="hour">00:00 to 20:00:</span> Some questions about the use of conditionals for methods. In general, the Frameworks as Express do that job for us. Differences between methods POST, PUT, PATCH. Cybersecurity questions about not to programm the conditionals for the methods.

                    <li><span class="hour">55:00 to 1:20:00:</span> File System Module. The Node.js file system module allows us to work with the file system on your computer. To include the File System module, we use the require() method: const fs = require('fs'); We saw the methods. fs.readFileSync(filename, charset): read a file. fs.writeFileSync(filename, charset) : write something in the file or create one. Question about the content/type and charset code. If we don't use the argument charset in the method fs.readFileSync() the file will be shown in the Terminal as >Buffer 41 41 41 41, like a set of numbers in binary code that represents the characters. fs.readFile(fileName, charset, (error, data) => {}): This is the asynchronous method for the module file system (fs) When everything is OK error is null and data has the content and when there is an error, the object error will be in the argument error and data will be undefined. This method .readFile has the same behaviour of asynchronous js functions. fs.writeFile(fileName, 'new content', (error) => {} An error that we can have with writeFile is that the file is in use, that the file is not in the directory. These are utilities not widely used</li>
                    <li><span class="hour">1:21:00 to 1:42:00:</span> fs.readFile(fileName, charset, (error, data) => {}): This is the asynchronous method for the module file system (fs) When everything is OK error is null and data has the content and when there is an error, the object error will be in the argument error and data will be undefined. This method .readFile has the same behaviour of asynchronous js functions. Use the fs.readFile() and fs.writeFile(). We can put the writeFile insisde the readFile method, the problem with this is that we will be creating a Callback Hell.</li>
